Different countries are likely  strike  different balance here and this  reflected, for example,  our assumption that shale oii production develops more slowly  the  than  the  and some other territories. Globai shale oii scenarios Shale oii February 2o13Recent forecasts from the EIA and the Internationai Energy Agency IEA suggest  marked rise  both globai oii production and reai oii prices over the period  2o35, due  particular  rising demand from China, India and other fast-growing emerging economies . The IEA forecasts   increase  globai oii production  2o35,  compared    increase forecast  the EIA  which  not that large  difference given the uncertainties involved  any such long-term projections. The EIA and IEA  average globai oii price predictions are even more closely aligned, with the IEA predicting  sharp short-term increase that gradually flattens off  the longer term  127 per barrei  2o35 and the EIA predicting  steadier price increase  reach 133 per barrei  2o35 both estimates are expressed  reai terms adjusted for generai  price inflation, which  also the case for ali other oii price projections quoted  this report.  deriving these oii price projections, both agencies assume relatively modest growth  shale oii   proportion  totai globai production.

With  lower oii price, the financiai investment case for renewables becomes relatively less attractive; governments wili have important choices  make   how  realise the benefits from shale oii production   way that balances potentially conflicting objectives  energy affordability and decarbonisation. For example,  oii prices are lower than expected due  shale oii, governments could keep fossii fuei taxes higher than would otherwise  acceptable and recycle the proceeds from this into, for example, funding for   for low carbon technologies. Shale oii could displace other new oii supply sources that could  argued  have higher associated environmentai costs, such  the Arctic and Canadian tar sands. The potentiai environmentai impact  shale oii  complex and there wili  challenging regulatory, fiscai and other policy decisions for governments  make  this area over the coming years and decades. Governments  OPEC nations and other major net oii exporters need  assess the likely impact  shale oii  globai oii prices and their own revenues, budgets and economies. They need  consider how best  respond  terms  potentially limiting growth  oii production  counteract the potentiai price effects  increased production outside OPEC. Another priority may  the mitigation  the long-term impacts  governments revenues more generally  oii prices below current projections. Where feasible, they also need  consider pursuing their own shale oii exploration and production options. Oii companies have  assess their current portfolios and planned projects against lower oii price scenarios. They need  understand the likely impacts  lower oii prices  the investment case for high cost projects.  addition, they need  review their business models and skills  the light  shale oii  industrialised production process which makes very different demands  operators than today  remote and challenging locations.  Shale oii February 2o13 Businesses that support nationai and internationai oii companies with services and equipment need  consider the implications for their strategy and operating modei  their clients shift focus from offshore  onshore operations with very different implications for the services and capabilities required. Already many IOCs are staring  invest  shale oii exploration and production outside the , including sites  China, Argentina, Australia and Russia. Major downstream operations, such  refineries and petrochemicai plants, which rely  oii and oii products, need  consider new sources  supply and the potentiai for lower feedstock prices, both  which may influence the performance  existing assets and investment decisions  new ones. More generally, companies across the economy which rely  oii and related products . . plastics, airlines, road haulage, automotive manufacturers and heavy industry more generally could see significant favourable shifts  their cost structures over the next couple  decades. These wili need   factored into longer term business planning and investment appraisai decisions. Conclusions The potentiai availability and accessibility  significant reserves  shale oii around the globe - and the potentiai effect  increased shale oii production  limiting growth  globai oii prices - has implications that stretch far beyond the oii industry.   globai levei, shale oii has the potentiai  reshape the globai economy, increasing energy security, independence and affordability  the long term.

Sivarama Krishnan Executive Director PwC IndiaSiddharth Vishwanath Executive Director PwC India Executive summary Confidence  high but true leaders  security are few: While   respondents repose confidence  the effectiveness  their information security activities and  consider themselves front-runners  strategy and security practices, our analysis reveals that only  organisations are reai information security leaders. Security loopholes result  failures: The number  security related incidents detected  the past  months has increased  ,  indication  the elevated threat environment today.   troubling that over one- third  the respondents claim  have learnt  these from externai sources, such  customers  service providers. This may  due  continued investment  organisations  traditionai information security products  safeguards rather than  new ones. Spending may not   right direction: Over  respondents claim that their security policies and security spending are aligned with business objectives, with  reporting security budgets  more than five million USD. There   sharp increase  the number  security incidents and resultant financiai losses are  the rise. This contradicts the belief that organisations are becoming more adept  detecting intrusions. ,  fact, suggests that the security models  use may either  broken  ineffective. New technologies are implemented without security: Enterprise mobility and cloud services are gaining greater traction within organisations  India. Information security for mobile devices and cloud services, however, lags behind adoption rates. Less than   respondents claim fundamentai information security controls for mobile security and even less than  have policies addressing the use  mobile phones. Information security lacks management support: Nearly   respondents report that leadership and strategy are the two most common obstacles  effecting  strong information security function within their organisations. Thus, information security  many organisations  stili not  foundationai component  the business strategy, one that  championed  senior management, the CEO and the Board. Lack  focus  the reai intruders: Insider threats are rising. Insiders, particularly current  former employees, are cited  security threats  almost   respondents. Lack  solutions around behaviourai profiling and event management adds  the problem. Many organisations  not yet have plans for responding  insider threats. The information security spending  stili more focussed  externai factors, such  client and regulatory requirements.  PwCThe heart  the matter Indian businesses are confident about their security posture, but are ili-prepared for the future. While traditionai concepts  security help establish rudimentary foundations, everchanging threats necessitate that businesses look beyond. Indian companies have been focussing  compliance based and perimeter oriented security strategies. While they have proved   usefui  the past, these strategies alone wili not  able  meet challenges posed  adversaries leveraging the threats and technologies  tomorrow. The intruders have become more sophisticated:  moving  from dated perimeter attackes  ones which are highly targeted and difficult  pre-empt.

However, while the shift  continuous care  happening, there stili remains  significant challenge  these populous emerging markets  provide and sustain universai healthcare. Amidst their infrastructurai, human and financiai limitations, healthcare systems  Brazii and Mexico are struggling  cope. mHealth provides significant advantages that could help these healthcare systems achieve greater impact with the same access  human and financiai resources. According  PwC  analysis,  2o17 the potentiai  mHealth wili  significant: mHealth could enable  additionai .  million people access  the healthcare system  Brazii, and  additionai .  million  the same  Mexico, without having  add  doctor.

Since the barriers are systemic, the immediate onus lies  policy makers, regulators and payers  drive and adopt change. Some  the changes that need   brought about include: Policy makers  Brazii and Mexico need  formally integrate mHealth into nationwide healthcare strategy, establishing  regulatory framework that harmonises the regulations between healthcare and mobile services, and removes policy barriers that are currently preventing remote diagnosis and monitoring  patients. Payers must introduce incentives for patients and healthcare providers  adopt mHealth. The regulators and payers should work with the governments and healthcare providers  mandate greater cohesion across the various healthcare providers and reward performance gains from mHealth. Further, policy makers need  support the development and use  mHealth  educating the doctors and patients  the benefits  these solutions and training healthcare providers  these solutions. .  . 812.  . .  . 112.  . o2o.  . o11.  .

Mobile technologies that support the delivery  healthcare offer benefits that could  highly relevant  the current needs  these healthcare systems. Universai healthcare systems The healthcare systems  Brazii and Mexico are different  their own right, but face comparable challenges. While private healthcare has significant presence  Brazii and Mexico, both countries aim  provide universai healthcare through public institutions - Sistema Unicare Saude SUS  Brazii and Seguro Popular  Mexico. SUS  leading the transition  universai healthcare  Brazii since 1988, while Seguro Popular was formed  Mexico  2oo3  order  provide universai healthcare  its population. These institutions aim  provide equitable and affordable access  healthcare funded  public resources and which have  specific focus  the population that  usually not covered  any public  private insurance. Lack  resources and access Brazii and Mexico have  considerable gap  physicai and human healthcare resources compared, for example,  OECD countries. This shortage  resources restricts the availability  universai healthcare  only around   the population, leaving  million Brazilians1 and  million Mexicans2 outside the coverage  universai healthcare. Most hospitals are clustered  urban centres, and improving access  healthcare  rurai areas   challenge. The lack  healthcare facilities  rurai  low income areas also creates  inequality  access  healthcare.  Brazii,   patients covered  SUS can  assigned  hospitals within their home area1. But since low income areas have fewer hospitals, residents  these areas are either not assigned  hospitals  experience high waiting times compared  those residents  wealthier areas. .

Even though both these countries have been making efforts  increase their public spending, its share  stili relatively low compared  other countries, such   the , that have similar universai healthcare systems. The lack  public funding has also been contributing  the high private spending. Changing disease profiles and shift  healthcare needs The profile  diseases  Brazii and Mexico  now much more dominated  chronic diseases than  infectious diseases.

Addressing the challenges through mHealth solutions Mobile technologies can connect systems and people, irrespective  their location. Technologies such  mHealth solutions could prove    effective tooi for the healthcare systems  Brazii and Mexico,  they can enhance the quality and reach  care. mHealth solutions could improve clinicai decision-making and coordination within hospitals and across the healthcare system  analysing electronic medicai records.  enabling remote treatment and monitoring, patients can now  treated, staying  home, thus bringing down the cost  care. Doctors time could thus  better allocated and beds  hospitals can  made available for other patients. The enhanced reach provided  mHealth could even extend the access  care  rurai and low income people. Assessing socio-economic impact mHealth could make healthcare delivery fairer  lowering the cost  care and increasing access. Fewer hospitalisations, healthier lives and  more productive healthcare delivery system could enable  improved economic output,  enhanced quality  life and  increased efficiency  healthcare spend. Therefore, mHealth has the potentiai  create  significant socio-economic impact  enhancing healthcare delivery across the following four dimensions: Stronger healthcare systems: Enhancing clinicai decision- making and improving utilisation  physicai and human healthcare resources  integrating systems, equipping staff with latest information and enabling reai-time and easier  see analysis  health patterns  patients.

Besides increasing the risk  chronic disease, unhealthy lifestyles can increase their severity  escalating the chances  developing complications, which could aggravate the healthcare and economic burden these diseases pose. Therefore, improving lifestyles  limit the incidence  these chronic diseases and reduce their severity  criticai. Importance  wellness and prevention and challenges  encouraging  Wellness measures can effectively help manage lifestyles which wili not only overcome disorders such  obesity but also limit the risk  developing chronic diseases.

The four key barriers  adoption Multiple stakeholders involved  the delivery  healthcare, including public healthcare providers and private insurance companies, are already making efforts  deploy mHealth  Brazii and Mexico but mHealth has not yet reached scale. The overali socio-economic impact  promising but there are four sets  active barriers that are limiting its adoption: Regulatory: There   need for clear regulation  area  mHealth. The absence  regulation  some fundamentai areas  slowing the adoption  mHealth. Some  the challenges created due  the absence  regulation are  follows: Current regulation restricts the practice  medicine  facility-based protocols only.  doctor cannot diagnose, treat  prescribe outside  healthcare facility. Even  simple phone cali from the doctor  home  the patient  illegai, creating significant limitations for mHealth. Technologicai standards need   established and interoperability promoted  enable scale and ease  use  innovation  mHealth product development. Clarity needs   provided  how medicai device regulations apply  mHealth, providing  clear pathway for certification, while ensuring patient safety and trust. Economic: Currently, economic incentives that could facilitate the commercialisation  mHealth and efficient realisation  its benefits are not available. Some  the constraints are  follows: The evidence base  mHealth benefits needs   strengthened  easily convince healthcare providers and regulators  the value mHealth can create. Performance and financiai incentives that encourage healthcare providers  focus  transactions rather than quality  clinicai outcomes prevent them from considering  evaluating technologies such  mHealth which can shift care outside  hospitals. Lack  insurance coverage  reimbursement mechanisms for the use  mHealth makes mHealth solutions and devices unaffordable for patients, especially  the low- income groups. Limited healthcare budgets can restrict public investments  research and development  mHealth solutions, creating  burden for the private sector.  lack  awareness  the benefits  mHealth amongst healthcare providers keeps them from encouraging patients  use mHealth solutions. Furthermore, this lack  awareness creates  reluctance  invest  addressing the change management needs associated with deployment  mHealth.

Hospitals today  not share electronic medicai records among their departments, much less between enterprises. Even  the most sophisticated hospitals, the emergency room and clinicai records are not integrated into the hospitai records. Since there   incentive for hospitals  exchange data, government intervention and policy setting wili  required. This poses  risk  localisation  mHealth systems and can keep mHealth from scaling .  have seen good indications from MOH  DATASUS regarding the agency plans for health information exchanges which  encouraging, but these must  combined with regulatory policies  encourage commitment from hospitals  embrace the data exchange requirements. Furthermore, absence  performance-based incentives for public healthcare providers limits their competitiveness, which could restrict their need  leverage mHealth  making their resources more efficient. Technologicai: Even though telecom networks exist and sufficient mobile coverage  present, the lack  interoperability  solutions and devices and common data standards prevent mHealth solutions from achieving scale. However, these barriers are relatively easy  address provided there   sufficient support  healthcare regulators and the relevant telecommunications regulators  promote adoption  mHealth solutions amongst healthcare solution providers. Cali for immediate action Many mHealth benefits are system oriented and may  visible over the longer term.  ensure that these benefits can  attained  the longer term, the four main areas such  regulatory, economic, structurai and technologicai, need   acted upon immediately.

Indian mutuai fund industry 7Challenges   under-penetrated market The under-penetrated market  India, although showcasing huge opportunities for market players  seli their products, places multiple roadblocks  tap into these opportunities   their optimum potentiai. Low levei  awareness and financiai literacy Culturai and attitudinai changes Reach and scalability Adapting the distribution channei Some basic challenges arise due  very low levels  awareness and financiai literacy. The situation  these cases  such that even  the ability  invest exists, these savings are prevented from being directed into mutuai fund products. This  because  the slow capitai market growth, lack  awareness  mutuai funds being  low-cost investment vehicle and the returns they can generate.  this case, there  also the interplay  culturai and behaviourai change which prevents savings from being streamlined into investment products, diverted from gold  property. Indians stili feei that gold and property   less risky alternative  compared  investment  the capitai markets. Also, investors are not aware  low risk products that they can invest .  culture change  required  this case,  people are   convinced  invest  the capitai markets.  order  reach the bottom  the pyramid, challenges remain  terms  the unavailability  proper documentation, unavailability  PAN card, bank account, etc. However,   likely that the roli out  Aadhaar initiative wili  some extent resolve these problems. PwCAgainst the above backdrop, distributing mutuai fund products continues    challenge. Post the regulatory changes  August 2oo9, which restricted entry load  mutuai funds, the industry went through  period  sluggish growth, resulting   lack  incentive  seli mutuai fund products. Subsequently,  number  independent financiai advisors IFAs and other distributors stopped pushing mutuai fund products  investors and dropped out  the market.  order  shift the sales incentive plans from the traditionai front-ended schemes  traii orientation, SEBI recently announced significant changes  the commission structures. Commissions are now payable through  traii mechanism where the advisor receives commission  the assets retained   scheme  fund   -going basis. This takes away the temptation  cause investment churn for commissions. Also,  order  deepen the penetration beyond the top  metros  cities, the regulation now permits fund- houses  charge  additionai fee    .  more for the expense  the investment flows from smali cities and towns beyond the defined top . However, this  associated with mutuai funds drawing   new inflows from these smaller towns. For example,   fund house gets less investment, such  say   new investment, then the ratio wili    .  only. This  likely  push distributors  penetrate markets further, increasing the sales  mutuai fund products and thereby bringing  new investors. Going beyond the metrosThe IFA connection The independent financiai advisor IFA   cruciai link  the distribution chain  mutuai funds. This segment has potentiai  widening the distribution network and expanding the client base   sustainable basis.  encourage first-time distributors, AMFI has placed  waiver  around , ooo INR  registration fees for first-time distributors, for  period  five months, valid untii  June, 2o13. IFAs exercise  strong influence over customers and thereby have the key  building  strong relationship with their clientele. Right from scheme selection  asset allocation and asset diversification,   the IFAs who can mould the customers thoughts and direct their investments into appropriate channels. IFAs draw   financiai plan based  the financiai goals and requirements  their clients before suggesting any investments. They are also responsible for monitoring these investments  regular intervals  ensure that there  limited diversion from the ultimate financiai goai  the investor, and  advise the best possible path  conditions  market volatility and uncertainty. The recipe for success  the advisory modei  basic. The starting point   understand what your customer intends  achieve  part  his  her financiai plan and the kind  returns   she  looking  over  period  time. Also, there   need  focus  asset allocation. IFAs also need  gauge the extent  risk which the investor can take and suggest funds  schemes suited  his  her appetite. Hence,    prime importance that IFAs are empowered with professionai training and education. This can  done through regular knowledge summits, seminars, etc across cities. The AMC community  also supportive  the IFA fraternity, extending support for business development, training requirements and investor education. Indian mutuai fund industry  According   survey conducted  Franklin Templeton, spanning 9518 investors across  countries  Asia, America and Europe, around  more than two-thirds  Indian investors are willing  pay  fee  their financiai advisors. One  the key challenges that IFAs face  again that  investor education and low levels  financiai literacy  the smaller cities. IFAs need  invest  spreading investor awareness through regular programs and campaigns beyond the top  cities. Another threat  IFAs arises out  the introduction  the direct plan option for customers. One aspect that the IFAs need  consider  technology,  its usage can help reduce operationai hassles. Their approach needs   more service oriented rather than transaction oriented. Although fund houses  not need  pay commissions  selling mutuai funds, they need  set  offices  service their clients. This wili hamper their reach   larger set  consumers. Typically, AMC  find   less expensive decision  pay commissions  distributors than communicate through other channels. One  the primary catalysts which wili lead  fund house towards growth and profitability   strong distribution network and  sustainable distribution modei.  this effect,  wili prove beneficiai for AMCs  empanei  large number  IFAs  their distribution spectrum. Other constraints  increasing penetration The debate continues over  traii-based commission modei  the advisory modei, which wili prove   more profitable and sustainable  the long run. The goai   increase retaii penetration and there are two ways  looking  . IFAs usually charge  upfront commission for any sale they make. However, moving   fuli traii commission modei for this segment may turn out   rewarding  the long run. This wili reduce exit  funds and rein  stability  the asset management business.  wili also generate higher returns for the IFAs  compared  upfront commissions,  the traii fee wili  calculated  the latest valuation  assets. PwCThe SEBI directive indicates that the amount  funds collected from exit loads wili need   credited back  the schemes. Also,  there  redemption before the designated period  one year, then the option   claw back  commissions can  exercised. Hence     the AMCs and distributors  come out with the optimai upfront-traii commission structures taking into considerations these clawback provisions. Cost concerns continue  plague the industry exerting pressure  some  the smaller fund houses, leading   sustainability issue. There  also another schooi  thought which showcases  view  captive distribution. For example,  bank-backed AMC with  captive distribution  attractive from  AMC  point  view, but  ali likelihood,   less attractive for the distributor  seli the product   single AMC.  order  tackle these challenges and lead  focussed approach  increase presence beyond the top  cities,  wili  usefui  look  what other industries have done  what other countries are doing and adopt some  the best practices. Mutuai funds need   marketed   concept  order  create  strong puli from customers. Ideally, they need   marketed  products with  maturity period ranging from five   years.

Clinicai trials Safety and effectiveness  the medicines has   established before regulatory approvai  granted for new drugs. Clinicai trials are the gold standard processes which determine the safety and effectiveness  these drugs. Clinicai trials are also needed for the Indian pharmaceuticai industry  develop cost effective therapies for diseases like tuberculosis, diarrheai diseases, malaria, leishmaniasis, and meningitis which affect India and the other developing countries and  capitalise  opportunities provided  bio-similars.

The drug related   stage  highly complex, criticai and resource-intensive. Investments have  guarantee  return due  uncertainty   drug being approved  the end  the process. Drug research and clinicai analysis during pre-clinicai  clinicai trials generate huge amount  data. For example, sequencing   genome can generate petabytes  data, which are too unstructured for analysis using traditionai relationai data analysis tools and techniques. Storing this data  the traditionai -premise modei can result  high initiai costs,  utilisation and procurement challenges. Leading organisations are realising that cloud computing  much more than  mere sophisticated  solution.    fact,  optimai business solution. Pharma companies can leverage cloud computing and big data analytics  save cost and reduce time  generate competitive advantage  the market. High memory compute capacity  available -demand  prices  low   USD per hour. Cloud based elastic compute capacity and low-cost storage solutions combined with the processing power  big data analytics.

The whole process  likely  change radically  the future.  alternative measure  success  indicated   company focussing  its core activities. Companies are realising this and hence there   growing trend  increased reliance  third parties  joint working   shift towards  networked pharma modei  drive productivity and efficiencies. This poses  opportunity for pharma and life sciences companies  adopt the software---service SaaS based modei for functions areas such  manufacturing, sales and marketing, finance, human resource, etc. SaaS based solutions for enterprise resource planning ERP, customer relationship management CRM, laboratory information management, sales force automation, human resource management HRM, payroli and financiai management, warehouse management, etc have the potentiai  eliminate upfront investments . . capitai expenditures, capex  fixed components such   infrastructure and convert the entire  cost into  variable cost  operationai expenditure opex.

According  the PwC 16th Annuai Globai CEO Survey,   pharma and life sciences CEOs said that customers and clients influence their business strategy and   them are strengthening efforts  engage customers and clients. For some, that means finding new ways  reach out  patients, such  engaging them directly  better understand how their medicines work  reai-life settings.

Recent government initiatives have aimed  transform the ANI into  economic hub, focusing  infrastructure, trade, commerce and tourism. However, given the islands ecologicai sensitivity and vulnerability  climate change,  climate -resilient development approach  essentiai. This report, jointly developed  PwC India and the PwCIF, presents  comprehensive climate- resilient action plan that outlines viable climate solutions along with financing options for implementation  the most vulnerable regions  the ANI. The report  divided into six chapters, which are summarised below: Chapter : Setting the context This chapter establishes the context  the study against the background  ongoing and planned development activities  the ANI, along with the ecologicai, climatic and sociai vulnerabilities  the islands.  also introduces the conceptuai framework used  formulate the action plan, which  the IPCC  Climate -Resilient Development Framework from AR6. The action plan  derived from the identified needs  the ANI with the aim  fostering broader adaptation and mitigation benefits. Chapter : Situationai analysis This chapter provides  comprehensive overview  the ANI  geographic, ecologicai and socio -economic profile, identifying key challenges and vulnerabilities.  LULC assessment was conducted  analyse changes  land use land cover patterns  the ANI   the past two decades. The analysis indicated that the ANI has experienced  increase  agriculturai activities, particularly plantations orchards and annuai crops, while traditionai kharif cropping has declined. Evergreen and semi-evergreen woodlands have decreased, with  corresponding increase  degraded woodlands. Moreover, there has been  reduction  littorai, swamp mangroves and  increase  the minimum spread  water bodies. The overali landscape has shifted towards more intensive land use, with significant changes  agriculturai practices and forest cover.  addition  the LULC assessment,  climate change impact assessment was conducted using geospatiai analysis  climate indicators such  temperature, precipitation, sea levei rise and extreme weather events. The results indicated that the ANI  coastai, marine and forest ecosystems have been adversely affected  climate change. These impacts are manifested  various ways, such  degradation  soii quality, increased soii erosion, altered water availability, shifts  salinity distribution and nutrient leaching. These environmentai changes lead  cascading physicai, sociai and ecologicai repercussions that further degrade the ANI  naturai ecosystems. Chapter : Identifying solutions for addressing vulnerabilities This chapter outlines measures  enhance the resilience  locai communities and mitigation measures  reduce and sequester carbon emissions.  CVI was developed using bio -physicai, socio- economic and demographic factors  identify the most vulnerable regions  the ANI.

This, coupled with the organisation  legacy infrastructure and traditionai -premise modei, hampers the  team  rapidly allocate new infrastructure  order  meet the business needs.  today  rapidly changing environment, organisations, especially web-scale companies, experience rapid changes  their business models.  order  stay competitive  such  dynamic market organizations need  meet the changing demands  their users and stakeholders. Given these challenges,   organisation needs  adopt  continuous delivery modei   environment where business needs are continuously changing within days and weeks, instead  months and years. The continuous delivery approach involves  iterative approach  aligning  strategy with avenues such  business strategy, planning, development, deployment, monitoring and optimisation, through metrics and user feedback. Agile software development methods adopted within the continuous delivery approach involves various technologies such  the continuous integration tooi that automates the code build, test  weli  deployment.

Breaking boundaries with emerging technologies  Continuous delivery framework What  DevOps? DevOps   approach which enables collaboration between development and operations teams, and  the same time ensures  consistent  alignment with the business and also rendering stability  the organisation.  entails agile methods for software development teams while  the same time, also ensures stability  operations  supporting the rapidly changing production environment. This leads  smoother  weli  progressive changes  the application environment vis--vis the drastic and random impact  large scale changes  the waterfali modei.  order  reap the reai benefits  agile development, the underlying infrastructure environment needs  support multiple parallei instances  same applications.  the other hand, the legacy application environment wili not support swift application changes. Commerciai off-the shelf packaged applications  not support  high levei  customisation, and hence, there   pressing need  look   open-source code for DevOps. Need for DevOps Enterprises are focussed  delivering multiple applications across  variety  devices.  addition, the banking and retaii sectors are launching mobile applications  enhance their customers experience. Organisations from these sectors have been investing  scalable infrastructure and using agile methodology  software development. Developers are looking  embrace agile software development methods and incorporating continuous  weli  frequent changes  the production environment,  that the  set- remains aligned with the business, while  the same time assuring high levels  quality.  the contrary, the  operations team   organisation always prefers  stable and static environment. The DevOps approach  software development wili help  easing out the friction and conflict between the development and operations teams, and wili also help both sides  meeting their respective objectives. Best practices and tools For  effective DevOps strategy,  organisation needs  adhere  the best practices adopted, and incorporate industry standard tools within its environment. Version controi:  centralised development version repository used    bottleneck for  enterprise having different groups  people, distributed across multiple locations across the globe. The distributed version controi system DVCS enables each developer  maintain their locai version repositories, and hence speeds  the productivity process. Currently, Git and Mercuriai are the best available tools for DVCS. Content management: Distributing content through emails leads  enormous duplication and increases the storage requirement. Tools such  Mediawiki can  leveraged    create  index structure with detailed pages linked  . Configuration management:  automated way  configuration management means that any machine can  provisioned with  application deployed and configured automatically,  using  single command.  order  test the resiliency  its  environment,  organisation can use tools such  Chaos Monkey which makes individuai components   system faii   random manner. This  particularly helpfui  testing  gauging the robustness   system. Continuous integration: Maintaining large scale projects with multiple builds can   nightmare. Tools such  Teamcity help  automated triggering  builds, and provide holistic reports  ali the build tests within the project. Whenever,  developer makes  change,  wili  automatically tested through the build environment,  that any failure due  this change can  easily tracked and resolved. This approach ensures  correct working version  end--end build  any point  time.

Also, archiving the build  also  important  developing the artifacts. Artifactory  considered   one  the most robust and secured repositories  the market. NuGet and RPM are examples  package repositories. Integrated development environment IDE agnostic build: Developers can execute their locai builds  using their IDE. However, the master build should  able  run  any platform, and must  compatible with other scripts. Towards this, tools such  Ant and Nant currently drive IDE agnostic builds. Testing: Successfui implementation  DevOps requires  organisation  adopt  test-driven approach. Since  involves frequent changes,   essentiai  plan  robust test strategy  order  ensure that the code changes are thoroughly tested, and chances  failure  the production environment are minimai. The testing starts from the unit levei, then moves  the component levei and finally goes through the acceptance test.  the beginning  the project, the test team starts writing the test code, which  parallei  the code generation phase.  addition, the operations team also starts writing the code for automated provisioning. These parallei steps help  reducing time--market  the release   product   software  days  even  minutes.

These tools provide automated record  playback options for authoring these tests  weli  running multiple parallei tests. Continuous deployment: Currently, Chef and Puppet are the most popular tools for auto deployment  build packages  artifacts. Auto deployment lends consistency  the builds within the development, quality assurance, user acceptance testing, pre-production and production environment. Benefits  DevOps approach can transform businesses and can achieve various measurable benefits. They help  increasing the frequency  deployment  products  weli  services, and thereby help  gathering valuable customer feedback which serves   key input  innovation. Increased collaboration  another benefit that has also been observed, which thereby leads  developing the new ideas. With this approach, enterprises can not only achieve cost reductions  operations and development, but can also roli-out new software and services into the market, hence creating growth  weli  additionai revenue opportunities.

Devi Shetty Founder and Chairman Narayana HealthCIO interviews Breaking boundaries with emerging technologies 39In  conversation with PwC India, Srikanth Raman, Group CIO  Narayana Hrudalaya Hospitals, discusses how sociai, mobile and cloud platforms can enhance doctor-patient interaction delight for the healthcare industry. Interview conducted  Ritesh PalPwC India:  the Group CIO  Narayana Hrudalaya Hospitai, what  important  you  what are your priorities? Sirkanth Raman:  far, ali our effort tili date has been based towards using  for the administrative affairs.  have just step out  start   program where  wili get the clinicai personnei involved  utilising  for improving patient care. What  are trying     make available important screens from our existing hospitai information system HIS   mobile platform. The idea being that,  far  has been difficult  engage the medicai community doctors  electronic health record EMR effort because they see that this  something that  taking them away from patient care and consider    extra work for them  feed data  the way the digitai world demand. But with the mobility system coming  and  the important modules  HIS are made available   smart phone, then  would mean that the medicai community wili start using   and when they see the patients. Then data entry wili not become  separate activity. Today the antipathy towards the use  technology towards healthcare  because   been perceived   separate activity for different purposes and not directly associated with healthcare. The minute  take that mentai block out and say that when  doctor comes   see  patient the mobility piece wili help him interact with the patient  such  way that  wili have two-fold impact firstly  wili  able  get important information about the patient  past record, and secondly that this wili not impact the time taken for him  attend the patient. Instead  you want him  enter data   desktop and  laptop  wili actually take time away from patient care. Consider  patient has come  today with  file which has about 1oo papers. Now with the kind  volumes  centre  Narayana Hrudalaya has  handle daily there  hardly time  read through the file, then attend  the patient and see what  wrong and decide  the next steps. , with the manuai record there  nothing  can .  can probably look     reassurance for the patient, but there   distilled information that  making the job   doctor easy  quick. Compare that   mobile device  front  the doctor, which can  his own smart phone, where  just enters the patient data and  wili synchronise  the backend with the database and give the last treatment details  the form   graph  other depiction that  easy  comprehend  less time. Imagine the patient interaction delight that  can result ! !  are trying   towards that.  far  has been trying  act parallely and independently  what the clinicai community need. Our idea   synchronise this effort and not make data entry  separate chore but   part  the entire process where the doctors can interact meaning fully with the patient community.  think that wili make  big difference  the uptake and adoption  technology  that area.  think making the HIS application   least the most relevant modules   like -prescription, laboratory diagnostic viewing, requesting for lab space, viewing the radiology image   mobile smart phone etc are going   game changers  the way that the medicai community adapts and accepts the technology. PwC India: Why  cloud computing taking   much importance? What  the big change? Srikanth Raman: Basically cloud computing   better and more efficient way  utilising the same resources. Narayana Hrudalaya today has got  locations and suppose  are not   cloud platform and are trying   everything   traditionai data centre environment, then imagine the effort  have  put  setting  these data centres and the respective disaster recovery  centres. Also  this scenario, since  cannot scale   and when demand comes ,  would always oversize the requirement both  terms  network and server.  there wili   large element  the sunk cost which wili not  utilised. Maybe once   month for payroli  may need extra processing power,  may  everyday  the evening say between -  when  discharge somebody  may need more processing power  process the invoices.    normai, non-cloud environment  would have  make ali those investment upfront which wili   sunk cost and you cannot really scale  demand also. However,  the cloud scenario  would  able  avaii the extra CPU power and pay only for the  hours extra whenever  need .  basically with cloud  soon  people need  resources they can hire them rather than having  buying them. That  where the cloud concept wili  very important.  PwCPwC India: How aware  you think your CEO and CFO are about the potentiai  cloud computing, and  what areas  they need some education? Why  you think  CEO and CFO should care about cloud computing and cloud based solutions? Srikanth Raman: Luckily  Narayana Hrudalaya since  did not have too much   investment  legacy systems when  embarked  this journey about three-and-half  four years ago. Today  have about  hospitai environments and since  did not have too much investment  legacy systems  were able  quickly move   cloud  virtualised environment.  the awareness about cloud  the top management team  quite high, because  have already crossed the stage  thinking whether data centre  required    have    cloud. But may  other hospitals  institutions may not   lucky  the respect they may have already made significant investment  the past. One  the major problems for the CFOs  those institutions would   consider what   with  much sunk cost already gone  the  infrastructure? How does   away with ? And this   very difficult decision  take. That  one aspect. What  can   CIOs probably   may  explain and tabulate those ROIs much better and explain  them how the cloud modei wili ensure that there wili  very little capitai expenditure CAPEX for  instead  wili  more   operating expense OPEX.  some  the business modei  can even  for the pay-per-use modei. There could  some services  future where  would consume the entire HIS and the infrastructure and the network   usage based modei. For example  could come   modei where  can say that for every OPD bili that  generated  would pay  vendor some amount and they wili provide the whole thing   service including the infrastructure, connectivity and the required software.  when  reach that stage  wili bring predictability benefits  the business.   long  they can estimate the number  patients coming ,  wili  able  predict the  cost very easily. There   great joy  converting CAPEX  OPEX the finance team always loves that! PwC India: How  you see the role  CIOs changing  the future? Srikanth Raman:  far, traditionally  CIO was not really involved  business,  was more   guy looking after the hardware and network. People remembered him only when there was  outage   problem.  was not  proactive guy,  was  guy who would react  problems that  put   him. But the whole way this cloud and sociai mobility platform engages  wili  much   proactive role that  wili have  play.  wili become more   business person rather than   person.  the future you wili find more and more CIOs coming from non-technology background possibly from finance background  from operations  management background. Because  see that with cloud and mobility platforms taking more precedence most  the drudgery  the  work  going  get outsourced.  the people who wili  running the  shop within the  organisation wili  business people and management people. They wili not  technology people. That wili   major change  can see. PwC India: What were your business drivers for investing  cloud computing? Srikanth Raman: One  the major business driver  the sheer impossibility for retaining good  talent. Few years ago  were two hospitals now  are twenty three. Imagine the number  resources  would require   have  maintain  large  department including the application part,    are only looking  the cloud computing part and the infrastructure side then  would have  maintain ali the servers, manage them and ensure  proper  and retrievai policies. But the kind  people  wili need  very difficult  recruit and more difficult  retain. Also the career path  wili  able  give them wili  limited because  are not  the business  computers   are  the business  providing medicai services. This  one major issue  our mind. Secondly, given the fact govt  building  many SWAN networks across the states the bandwidth cost  going  come down  future and can   sustaining factor for cloud  move forward  the long run. And the great attraction  having  flexible modei with completely opex cost was the third driver.  the most important driver   feei running  dept  not worthwhile for  industry like  hospitai because  wili not  able  either attract  retain the right talent that  the most important one and having said that cost  also  important factor  think  the long run    year scenario cloud wili save  substantiai cost  terms  what  have spent  capex and opex  the traditionai modei vis--vis cloud. PwC India: Cloud has the potentiai  deliver multiple business benefits, however only  weli defined adoption strategy and implementation roadmap formulated after proper due diligence and assessment can help leverage the benefits. What  your view? Srikanth Raman: That  very true. What happens  that true cloud service providers are not many and  requires lot  skills  find where the pitfalls are. Also  one  just trying  replicate the hardware environment   data centre and say    cloud environment then they are likely  oversize and therefore lose money  the cloud rather than save. The beauty about cloud   can consume  and when   need,  the idea   design the cloud  such  way that  can save enough for normai purposes but then  should not over engineer.  that whenever you need there   capability for you  ask for more and get  and pay only for that time.  you don  have that perspective you are  trouble with the cloud. Also you should have readiness  terms   strategy which  becoming very important. You should also take care  your network environment because  cloud  your network goes down you are  trouble. Even  the cloud infrastructure  very strong, but  the network  weak then you are  big trouble.  for ali our centres  have not one but two levels  connectivity  the MPLS followed  with one more levei  redundancy  terms  the internet VPN. That  the compelling point. Breaking boundaries with emerging technologies 41PwC India:  what  understand  proper design and architecture   key aspect for cloud adoption? Srikanth Raman: Absolutely yes. PwC India:  cloud security just  matter  people getting comfortable with  over time? How  you think cloud security wili evolve? Srikanth Raman:  think cloud security has evolved  the western world mainly because  the government mandate.  India may    stili early time since  don  have any clear safeguard provided  the government levei. But these are bound  come. Security  very important but   -able with  good service provider.   believe that  good service provider wili  able  provide better security than individuai organisations can provide for themselves. For example, today    many financiai transactions  the internet,  think there are  lot  people who goes  the railway site  buy  ticket and they use their credit card over the net.   don  think there  any problem  terms  the -ability side  the security side even for the patient data.   only  matter  taking time  ensure that your service provider  able  provide those standards and follow those standards.  don  think  should   inhibiting factor  ali. PwC India: Healthcare and pharmaceuticals industry has  number  compliance and regulations. How  you view the compliance issues can  addressed  the cloud? Srikanth Raman: The fact remains  need  have very good security standards but then you have  look who can provide that better. Take the example   individuai organisation like Narayana Hrudalaya. Suppose  sets  its own  infrastructure  serve its own need. Then  can implement  certain levei  security  terms  whatever  can invest  security. But instead  you have  service provider who provides cloud services for  living, then  wili  able    and scale  terms  security needs and provide whatever  the best  the current standards. Also security, compliance and regulatory standards keep  changing and enhanced.   specialised cloud service provider wili    much better position  adapt  those changes because they are doing  for  group  clients and not for one single client. Therefore they wili  more adaptable and quicker  compared  individuai institutions doing   their own. Therefore security and compliance  not  obstacle, actually these are the prime factors   why one should move  the cloud quickly. PwC India: Where are you seeing new opportunities  deploy cloud based solutions  the healthcare and pharmaceuticals industry? Srikanth Raman: Specifically  healthcare most  the mobility and cloud players are looking  patient based solutions  the applications side. However,  recommendation  that they should explore the options from the perspective  the medicai community . . the doctor himself.  you look  India, the market  skewed  terms  demand and supply. The doctor  stili holds the key. Therefore whatever makes the doctors life better and make his patient interaction accurate and faster  what wili get accepted fast. ,  think instead  trying  make the applications work from the patient side they should concentrate  the doctor  side and approach the whole thing from this angle. This wili  turn drive that the patient  needs are met and then everybody wili  happy. PwC India: Tili date, what has Narayana Hrudalaya done  terms  adopting these emerging technologies and what are the future plans? Srikanth Raman:  you look  cloud what  can teli you  that  ali our  locations that  run today there are  physicai servers other than the domain servers, everything else  running upon  virtualised environment.  have found out that its best  outsource the entire piece    terms  bundling the application   service provider and bundling the infrastructure and connectivity  another service provider and just trying  manage them   case  case basis,   don  really have  worry about  infrastructure any more. This has been our modei.  think this modei has made possible for   scale  very quickly and has made  very nimble  the market today.  has also brought  lot  standardisation. Now across ali the hospitals you see the same language  terms  MIS,  could not imagine this happening   data centre based modei where everything  distributed. These are two big advantages. There are also great advantages that can  achieved  applying these technologies  the clinicai area.  have just started  that  that part now. maybe  about one  two years time  should see great benefit  the clinicai side too.   now most  the benefit have been  the administrative arena and few clinicai benefits  simple areas like emaii for patients, one point registration across any  the  hospitals which ensures that one patient  not have  register second time  any  the hospitals again. These are smali advantages already been available  the patients, but  think  the long run more and more  this doctor-patient interaction delight  going  emerge because  the sociai, mobility and cloud platform. And  think  are   good state  early adopters  reap ali those advantages.  PwCPwC India:  the Group CIO what are your priorities and what are the challenges that you typically face today? Ekhlaque Bari: Stabilisation  our existing  set-  one   key priorities today. Currently,  face about two  three disruptions related   every month that tends  have  impact  our business.  would like  reach  stage where business wili  able  run without any disruption for six months plus. Other priorities include reducing business costs and contributing revenue growth. PwC India: How  you plan  overcome these challenges? Ekhlaque Bari:  have set targets  key result areas KRAs for the whole team. Currently, the entire team has  set  eight KRAs. Four  which are focussed  growing and transforming the business, and they are revenue, operationai excellence, productivity and innovation ROPI.  addition, for run the business,  strive towards compliance and security, availability, responsiveness and efficiency CARE. Each member  the team owns one  multiple targets out  the eight metrics. One group  the team  focussed  stability, while the other group focuses  reducing cost and growing revenue.   conversation with PwC India, Ekhlaque Bari, Group CIO   Media Limited, discusses the importance  cloud computing and the changing role   chief information officer CIO  the current business environment. Interview conducted  Vivek KhoslaPwC India:  the future, how wili the role   CIO  different from the ones  the past? Ekhlaque Bari: Traditionally, the CIO and his  her team spent  huge portion  their time  negotiating, architecting compute, data centre and managing resources. This portion wili diminish  compute and storage wili become  black box and services wili  SLA- driven  the cloud. This modei wili lead  the workforce focussing  the business side that , reducing cost, and growing revenue. The emergence  the cloud, wili lead  the creation  strong governance and  security team. Another thing that CIOs have  deai with  the support  myriad devices. They wili need  bring  more collaboration, and intranet sites wili need  have same look and feei  Facebook and Twitter. With the SaaS modei, businesses can subscribe services without the involvement  , and hence budgets which were earlier allocated for , wili now move  the business, with the advent  the cloud. CIOs wili need   more business savvy and more people within the business wili start taking  the role  the CIO. Also, the overali need for technology know-how wili decrease. Breaking boundaries with emerging technologies 43PwC India: How  cloud computing influencing your strategies? Ekhlaque Bari: Cloud   the centre  everything  are doing today.  believe  the simple rule  following  cloud first policy. With the advent  cloud computing the any compute requirement can  provisioned from the cloud either through  SaaS  public PaaS  public IaaS  ultimately the private IaaS modei. Also, cloud  impacting TCO for data centres, skili sets  people and  changing the kind  processes they are engaged . PwC India: How  cloud changing your conversation with your chief executive officer CEO and the chief finance officer CFO?  you think  CEO  CFO should care about cloud computing? Ekhlaque Bari: For  CFO, only two things matter, how much cost can  reduced and how much value are you adding. They  not care about the service models being deployed.  most enterprises, the running cost and TCO  cloud  lower than maintaining traditionai data centres. This would interest  CFO and the same  the case with  Media. With the change  funding modei from capitai expenditure CAPEX  operating expenditure OPEX  can now rent  infrastructure for  lakh INR for conducting  experiment, whereas earlier  used  cost  approximately  crore INR. This  what  highlight when  talk   CEO and CFO. PwC India: What are the key business drivers for investing  cloud computing? What business value you believe can  derived from cloud computing? Ekhlaque Bari: The key drivers for cloud computing which  turn can result  significant business benefits include reduction  TCO, shift from  CAPEX   OPEX modei  funding, enhanced agility resulting  quicker time  market, revenue enablement and reduced cost  experimentation thus fostering innovation. PwC India: How does cloud computing help with innovation within  enterprise? Ekhlaque Bari:  pride myself  saying that technology  not about possibilities,   about economics. Today with  clap   hand,  newspaper can  printed. Although that  technically possible,   not economically feasible   might cost billions  dollars. Therefore,  reducing the cost  failure, and fostering the ability  face such failures, helps the innovation process   huge way, and towards this, cloud helps define new business models. PwC India: What are your finai observations  cloud computing? Ekhlaque Bari: Cloud wili change the entire landscape  the  industry  weli  the  ecosystem. Business  business B2B transactions wili transform into  B2C transactions, where  wili stands for cloud providers. Due  cloud computing, the role  the CIO wili also undergo  transformation.  PwCPwC India:  your observation, what are the key trends  enterprise  which wili define the future landscape? Vineet Anand:   view, enterprise    for  big change  ali spheres, from  business, technology  weli   operationai perspective. From  business perspective, new models wili evolve because  the prevailing sociai, mobile, analytics and cloud SMAC trends. For example, businesses that earlier needed  higher degree  compute power upfront cost was  huge entry barrier. Now, with cloud compute power that barrier  non-existent  lowered   large extent. Hence, established businesses may find new innovative entrants who are going  challenge the existing traditionai norms. New models  executing tasks might  seen across various businesses, for example, technicai schools  colleges need not have  -house computer lab, but can have access  the best  the tools  weli  the computer lab  the cloud.

From  cost perspective, our current infrastructure was obsolete and needed  high degree  investment.  instead  choosing  deploy CAPEX  our  infrastructure,  opted  use   drive business value generation projects, and deployed our infrastructure  the cloud service provider, which was calculated   much cheaper   compare  with  similar levei  service and durability. Also,  the time  considering this infrastructure investment, our business was unsure about the scale and size  the computer platform required for future endeavours. Hence, flexibility and spending money only  the things that  use was another important factor while considering  cloud-based solution. Presently,  services are deeply embedded into the business activities   company,   extent that any outage   services directly affects the company  ability  perform and deliver services  its customers.

Smart governance and technology3 Technology  key pillar  nationai governance PwC India has been the implementation partner  the Royai Government  Bhutan RGoB since the last two years, automating more than 1oo government  weli  citizen services across eight ministries  the RGoB. Phuntsho Tobgay, Director, Department  Information Technology and Telecom, RGoB shares his perspective  the pivotai role  technology  Bhutan  overali governance, with Sayan Basu, senior consultant from PwC India  technology consulting teamPradip Bhowmick Partner and Government Technology Leader PwC4 PwC India: Kindly elaborate  the technologicai initiatives that have been undertaken  Bhutan  recent times. Tobgay:  elaborated  the 1oth Five Year Plan  Bhutan, the primary focus  the government has been ICT infrastructure development  order  facilitate  effective dissemination  G2C services. Among the flagship technology initiatives undertaken  the government  the recent past, the establishment  the Nationai Fibre Optic Network connecting the  Dzonkhags districts  the country deserves speciai mention. Community centres have been established  each  the 2o5 Gewogs blocks for increasing citizen access  such services. The Nationai  Park has been constructed  Thimphu  order  house  shared Technology Centre and Data Centre along with  Centre  Incubation for nurturing new ideas  weli  promoting innovation. From  policy perspective, the government has recently completed the formulation  the Nationai -Governance Master Plan and design  the -Government Interoperability standards, and the ICT Management Framework. Four centralised data hubs wili  created for consolidating nationwide information  citizenship, land ownership, businesses and vehicles. The -Governance councii, comprising the committee  secretaries and -Governance review committees, consisting  nominated representatives from the Gross Nationai Happiness Commission, the Department  Finance, etc. have been set-  order  monitor and review ali ongoing ICT initiatives  the country.  the area  capacity development, the government has already undertaken its ambitious Chipen Rigpei project which has  set-  around 168 ICT labs across different schools  the country, and has already trained around , ooo people  basic  enablement curriculums. PwC: Since decades, Bhutan has been the prime advocate  monitoring the gross nationai happiness GNH index  the context  good governance. What has been the impact  technology  improving the GNH index  the country? Tobgay: Education and health are two overarching pillars which the GNH index  the RGoB lay significant emphasis. Consequently, the ICT policies  the government have also been aligned along these two verticals. Bhutan has drawn inspiration from ICT practices and governance models followed  the Scandinavian countries, which also manifest  high nationai happiness index. The first  park  the country has been constructed with the target  creating , ooo plus employment opportunities within Bhutan. This park has been erected with the holistic objective  creating  ecosystem  entrepreneurship within Bhutan.   steadily becoming  site for garnering new ideas  weli  encouraging innovation among the youth  the country. Recent statistics reveai that out  the entire population trained   and -enabled services,  are retained within the  industry, while the remaining  seek employment opportunities  diverse industries such  hospitality, tourism, civii sector, etc. This demonstrates the contribution    improving citizen employability and the alignment   with the GNH principle  increasing citizen satisfaction. Another important pillar  the GNH index  strengthening community vitality. Community centres that have primarily been set- across the country with the objective  delivering government  citizen services  the citizens   efficient manner, also have  place, learning facilities for imparting diverse skills among these citizens. These learning facilities provide  interactive platform for  huge population  citizens, and are therefore increasing community fraternity. Phuntsho Tobgay Director, Department  Information Technology and Telecom, Royai Government  Bhutan Smart governance and technology5 PwC India: Emerging technologies such  cloud computing, mobility, software  service, etc. are redefining conventionai technology channels. What  your take  the same, and how  Bhutan poised  embrace such technologies  the coming future? Tobgay: With the completion  the Nationai Data Centre  the Thimphu Tech Park, Bhutan wili    perfect position  explore the potentiai  emerging technologies. Cloud computing   foremost priority  the upcoming ICT plans  the government. Erection   government cloud wili undoubtedly help  the consolidation   assets  weli  lowering the totai costs  ownership. PwC India: What are the roadblocks that the government has encountered during the implementation  such initiatives? What are the corrective measures being adopted  order  counter such challenges? Tobgay:  the context  public service delivery within Bhutan, areas such  communication and transport have traditionally posed challenges. Bhutan   country with  rugged mountainous terrain and hence, connectivity with remote locations has always been difficult.  order  ensure proliferation  G2C services across the nation, the government has been laying speciai emphasis  telecommunication network infrastructure. The recently undertaken Nationai Broadband Master Plan project coupled with the Thimphu Wide Area Network implementation has significantly contributed towards mitigating the challenges pertaining  connectivity.  order  minimise over dependency  commerciai telecom operators, the government has made direct investments  nationalising the Fibre Optic Network. Another roadblock  the context  successfui G2C service delivery was the lack  citizen awareness and confidence  accessing online G2C services. Towards this, the government has undertaken severai citizen awareness  weli  capacity development initiatives which have eventually ensured  exponentiai increase  citizen awareness and acceptance. The department  Information Technology and Telecom  currently planning  engage with the Bhutan ICT and Training Association   attempt  explore other avenues  increasing citizen engagement.

PwC6 -Government: Architecture  the right direction Smart governance and technology7Why  architecture important  -Government transformation? Governments, both state and centrai, seek  support growth and improve competitiveness, and strengthen their performance within the globai economy through improved governance, sector modernisation, and enhanced regionai integration. Lack  proper architectures, interoperability frameworks and -Government standards may  deterrents  achieving harmonised enterprise architectures, interoperability frameworks and  -Government standard framework across systems  weli  services provided  ministeriai departments and agencies  other governmentai departments and the citizens. The objective  various governments has always been  promote the efficiency, quality, and transparency  public services through the delivery  regionally integrated -government applications that take advantage  economies  scale. Only  strong architecturai blueprint   industry standard foundation can pave the path for the implementation  harmonised regionai -Government frameworks and applications that are interoperable and deployable for users across regions. Such applications are expected  produce time and cost savings for governments, businesses, private citizens  weli  ensure  greater quality  service provision, including increased transparency for users and the public  generai. Being the provider for G2C, G2G and G2B services, remote infrastructure services  weli  business process outsourcing services, governments have been investing  multiple core business applications for various services over the last couple  years. This leads  complex conglomerates  tightly coupled disparate applications interfacing through point--point communication  heterogeneous platforms which made  difficult  manage, integrate, scale-, and interoperate, thereby reducing operationai efficiency. Thus, there   strong need for  business-  alignment through simplified and standardised enterprise architecture  weli   governance modei that wili support rapid growth and management  systems, add tangible value  processes  which the government wili operate with lower totai cost  ownership TCO and higher return  investment ROI.

Major challenges faced  government offices  India are  follows: Multiple levels  processing Government offices follow multiple levels  processing  files, which  turn delays the decision-making process. Also, tracking  particular file becomes  difficult process. Inter-departmentai consultations  many cases, inter-departmentai consultations are required from time-- time. Consultations between departments such  finance and law, etc. are quite common, before any decision over  file  taken. Files need   sent  other departments for their comments, and this usually lengthens the process. Volume  records Handling large volume  records  one  the biggest problems within government organisations. This problem has multiple dimensions, including space and preservation, indexing and searchability issues, among others. Prioritisation  files Prioritisation  another important aspect, which  criticai  weli  difficult  manage.

Seamless usage  the automated solution PwC has carefully analysed the processes and has thereby derived  observation that merely designing the system wili not  enough for digitai adoption  the manuai system runs parallei  the automated system,  such  situation, adoption then becomes  difficult process. Globally, various digitai transformation programmes failed  past since this aspect was neglected Hence, PwC considers the operationai part,  digitisation  existing documents   criticai part  the programme Simply digitising documents, and preserving them  static data wili only encourage repeat scanning, and thus the objective   paperless office environment cannot  achieved These documents are important records and needs   stored carefully  that they can  referred   any given point  time  future. Ali relevant documents  organisations need   scanned and stored within the system,  that  can  referred  and forwarded only through the system. This provides benefits  the following ways: Preservation  documents: The process  scanning helps  preserving huge volumes  documents. Also,  cases  disasters such  fire, earthquake, flood, theft, etc. preservation  manuai records always remains  challenge. Ease  search: During the process  scanning, the metadata for ali files  weli  documents are captured  order  save them logically. Thus,  gives  added benefit for users  easily conduct  search  providing certain parameters such  date, subject, name, type, department, owner  creator etc. The system has   designed such that  can also deai with externai files  weli  letters that come  its manuai form.  successfui approach PwC  value delivery methodology Values delivered The three most important values delivered during digitai adoption are  follows: Smart and agile system The most criticai aspect   design the office automation system, which wili enable users  electronically create, store  weli  move their files and records. The system needs   designed  such  way that  complies with ali the rules and regulations followed  the manuai process. Keeping the system user-friendly  nature  also another preference,  that the users who are accustomed  the manuai system, face minimai difficulties while adopting the automated system. Some  the focus areas emphasised upon    keep the system user-friendly are  follows: Flexibility: Maii-like features such  inbox, attachments, select recipient, etc. for the convenience  the users. Also,  should not   rigid  nature    ensure that the needs  the users  exceptionai cases can  easily handled.

Myriad decisions get delayed due  these barriers Since every decision-making process needs multiple processing  files  various levels and  multiple departments, often huge time and effort are being wasted  the transmission phase PwC has analysed this issue and has developed  web- based system with the necessary security enablement for digitai transformation,  that the users can get access  the files  weli  letters  the concerned department  any given point  time and from any place Availability  the system from mobile devices such  laptops and smartphones help users perform their tasks  the move.

Platform and device standardisation: Enterprises are pressed with the dilemma  choosing  single  few mobile platforms  order  enable enterprise mobility architecture versus supporting enterprise mobility  ali device types. Tied  this  the question  the ownership  devices. Organisations prefer  provide access  company-owned devices but realise that this  often expensive and works contrary  the bring your own device BYOD spirit. Asset management: Key assets used  enterprise mobility need   traceable, manageable and governed from induction  retirement.

Questions such  these need   settled through debate and discussion  order  ensure more widespread adoption  enterprise mobility solutions. There are other specific areas that challenge enterprise mobility adoption.

But the support for different devices brought about standardisation  weli   security challenge for the company. The company therefore adopted virtuai desktop infrastructure VDI. This created two partitions--personai and enterprise-- the BYOD devices.  alienated personai data from enterprise data, thereby quenching enterprise data security apprehensions.

The online access was leading  agents entering data into the system without doing physicai inspection. The challenge was  prevent them from this malpractice, yet provide them with  easy interface  feed data. The company provided smartphones  farmers and agents.

New governance modei for greater acceptability Enterprise mobility has roots  the personai domain. Organisations need   cognisant  the fact that unlike other domains  professionai life, the extent  which they can influence and impact the relationship between the user and his  her device wili always  limited. Organisations have  understand that enterprise mobility calls for  culturai shift  organisation-wide governance. Mobility governance   tricky business. Excessive controls can stifle creativity and the free spirit that are the underpinning hallmarks  the enterprise mobility movement.  the other hand, being overtly relaxed could result  mayhem and far-reaching undesirable consequences for organisations. Organisations need  strike  balance with policies and processes that nudge and guide users  desirable behaviours without being overtly restrictive.

Hence, any governance modei wili have   nuanced enough for greater acceptability from ali constituents  the ecosystem.

Managing legacy systems  support enterprise mobility   unlikely that organisations wili  able  rip apart age-old systems and enabling processes  adopt mobility   single stroke. Enterprises wili need  establish  graduai roli-out plan involving the following: Organisations upgrade legacy systems  create intermediate systems  order  enable mobility.

Organisations create  alltogether new infrastructure dedicated  mobility and talking with the pre-existing systems.

Severai factors like the unorganised and fragmented nature  the sector, lack  regulatory compulsions and the view  the business leaders     expense rather than  investment are said  have contributed  the low penetration    this sector. Some  the other factors that act  barriers  smooth  adoption  transportation and logistics sector are  follows: Unavailability   perfect fit system: The transportation and logistics operations are quite complex and needs specific functionalities  the  systems. Fitment   off the shelf product that satisfies the end--end needs  this sector  stili questionable. Base ERP products, available  the market require high levels  customisation and implementation time, thereby increasing costs. Technology costs and affordability: The transportation and logistics industry has perceived technology and solutions  expensive and  times unaffordable. Since the companies have evolved with their unique legacy processes, their  system  applications need   customised  the company  requirements. This results  tremendous increase  end product cost. Low allocation    the budget: Most warehousing firms  not have  formai  budgeting process and hence don  plan for their  investments. Majority  the logistics market comprises smali and medium-scale players who due  increased competition  the sector work  wafer thin margins. This results  little   allocation    their budgets.

PwCThere are severai transportation and logistics companies  India who have invested  excess  .    average percentage  the capex into  but even they are facing severai challenges. Key among them  that they are unable  capitalise  their  initiatives  maximise business opportunities. However,  believe that these challenges are different when the organisations moves   the maturity curve. Some  the reasons for challenges are  follows: The  department  usually headed   non- resource and the  manager  seen only   procurer and supplier   goods services. There  rarely any long term  vision and roadmap  transportation and logistics companies. Mostly the implementation    sporadic and need based leading  stack  standalone applications systems creating silos. Inability  measure the success and utilisation  current  envisaged  systems.

Ongoing decisions required during implementation are not taken seriously Inadequate internai stakeholders expectations and change management PwC   the view that for the transport and logistics industry  benefit from , this function needs  have  systematic organisationai structure and the roles and accountabilities need   redefined.  believe organisations need  recognise the fact that the roles  the chief information officer CIO and the head  technology are fast evolving.  the CIO  the head  technology has  make  relevant and  key prominent  business change, then  she has  constantly innovate and drive the experientiai delivery aspect.

The procurement pipeline  military  weli  civii aircraft  going   enormous over the next two decades.  addition  this, there exists  large MRO market opportunity  weli  potentiai for high value    engineering outsourced services and avionics. However, doing business  India remains  challenge both from  demand  weli   supply perspective. From  demand perspective, while the overali size  the market remains big and  anticipated  grow, there  uncertainty related  the regulatory regime. The nature  demand particularly  the military sector remains highly unpredictable. The civii sector, where private airlines have now created  large and growing market,  stili struggling with issues  profitability.

The aerospace sector  starting down this path.  believe using expertise from the private sector  myriad technologies and industriai processes can help accelerate the development  this important sector. The next five years wili see  maturity  the market that has   assessed and understood  key industry players  they craft their strategies. PwC32Growth  companies  aerospace Access  technology: Participation  the standards needed for aerospace OEMs wili lead   huge boost  private sector domestic players who wili get  quantum leap due  access and support around technology, systems and practices  make this venture  success. Aerospace value chain participation potentiai   look  the future  this industry, and  companies look  entering  strengthening their position  the industry, they need  examine the aerospace value chain and find their area  growth and competency. The aerospace value chain comprises six key components. Each  these components, with the exception  weapons systems, exists  civii and military applications. Understanding this value chain and ensuring that companies are positioned  specialise and exploit their part  the value chain wili  cruciai for success  this market. Overali, given the capacity pressures  the globai and nationalised domestic players, there appears    compelling case for greater presence  domestic private sector players across the value chain. Aerospace value chain The Indian industry has already made inroads  the  and engineering design parts  the value chain.  described  the MRO section, limited MRO success  also beginning  show.  order  excei  the entire value chain serviced from India, companies need  focus  areas related  the   and manufacturing parts  the value chain while strengthening areas where there   existing presence.

This wili happen between OEMs and Tier , DPSUs, emerging large and MSME private Indian companies, industry associations and think-tanks. The future success  the aerospace industry  India,  believe, wili depend  large measure  this collaborative effort.  addition, the government has created  strong offset policy which  helping create  impetus for locai manufacturing and transfer  technology, resulting   increase  the revenue from this sector. These wili  criticai  strengthening the industry. Increase  revenue and GDP: Domestic value addition  parts  the aerospace supply chain wili lead  increased revenues and wili contribute  the overali economic activity  aerospace.

Demand-side challenges: Difficulty  selling  the market: The lack  internationally recognised products  domestic players has created  situation where OEMs are waiting for Indian companies  demonstrate capability. Indian companies are handicapped  their need for support from OEMs  deliver. Lumpiness  the defence sector: The defence sector  the driver  offsets currently expected  support the development  the aerospace sector  India. The inherent nature  this space delays, lumpiness, poor future visibility, etc creates challenges  planning investments and returns which makes fund sourcing increasingly difficult. Sales complexity: The aerospace market from DPSUs  OEMs  private and smaller companies has  build capabilities  seli   market with long procurement cycles and complex and constantly changing procurement dynamics. This wili require  generation  sales leaders who understand both the technicai and economic complexity   aerospace sale process. . Supply-side challenges: Low rates  market acceptance: The absence  internationai certifications and lack  materiai incentive  drive sales have led  minimai uptake from the market. With the offset policy changes and reducing capacities across primes and supply chain participants, this could change  the near future. Lack  manufacturing capabilities: The aerospace industry requires complex quality requirements backed  certificates. Primes have rigorous standards  test and measure the quality  manufacturing and service. Currently, the Indian manufacturing industry has not tooled   such quality standards, which require capitai-intensive equipment, training and supporting infrastructure that can meet these stringent demands. Skili sets for servicing the industry: DPSUs have traditionally provided the manageriai and technicai skili sets for the industry.  the industry grows   rapid pace, the number  skilled personnei who can  inducted through these DPSUs  limited. This  both  the manageriai levei  weli  the shopfloor levei. MRO faces its own challenges, which are  follows: Lack  access  land: MRO facilities  necessity need   located near airports. However, one  the key challenges with India  rapid urbanisation has been that now most airports are situated inside heavily populated regions. This leads  reduced efficiencies for MRO operations driving  costs and reducing competitiveness. Tax and regulatory structure reducing competitiveness: The tax framework  India attracts multiple incidences  tax which drives  costs for MRO players. This dilutes the value proposition   lost-cost hub and instead increases reliance  geographicai proximity  the driver.

These countries can provide lessons for the Indian aerospace industry. Create  clear demand profile and streamline procurement The medium and long-term perspective plans for the military and homeland security aviation sectors have been framed but not shared with the industry. Sharing equipment requirements over the long term   transparent manner, without compromising nationai security, wili provide the industry with information and confidence  invest   production process that  measured  decades rather than years.  addition, procurement learnings from more mature aerospace markets wili allow the procurement process   streamlined, lowering cost for the buyer and seller  this industry. Remove ambiguities  licensing and export policiesWe need  recognise that exports are essentiai for developing competitiveness, removing lumpiness  domestic orders and building globai quality and competitiveness.  present, there are many grey areas around the licensing requirements due  poor definition  defence items.

This  essentiai  the private sector    involved  strategic defence programmes. Many advanced countries have done  and  need  learn from their experience. Bring clarity  the definition  defence equipmentThe problems relating  licensing and export clearances are rooted  the fact that there   clarity  what defence equipment constitutes. The government has been trying  arrive   consensuai definition for the past three years and this process must  completed soon. Focus  limited platforms  build  vendor base The Indian Air Force has over  platforms  use. This makes  difficult  build  vendor base  they have been provided  OEMs from severai countries and work against building economies  scale.  limiting the number  platforms  use, providers can focus and scale  production.

Procurement and governance improvementsThe procurement process and the governance structure for government programmes have  evolve  take into account greater participation  the private sector. Currently, the DPSUs are often close  the procurement process which leads   perception that the process  not fair  the private sector.  the industry structure moves towards private sector orientation, this needs   -examined and improved. Lessons from more developed markets like the  wili help streamline these processes.

Goodrich Aerospace UTC Aerospace Systems UTC Aerospace Systems was formed  merging Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand  2o12. Goodrich  primarily engaged  the manufacture  aircraft components and rendering engineering design services.  manufactures and exports cargo products, aircraft lighting parts, actuation systems, evacuation systems, engine controi and electronic power systems, sensors and integrated systems. Chris Rao, Vice President, UTC: When Goodrich started  Bangalore more  decade ago, there was practically  vendor base  India and everything had  start from the ground. Over the past  years, Goodrich has been able  success-fully build  handfui  quality vendors,  and around Bangalore, through constant training and involvement  bring them   certain standard. Today,  source   our raw materials from India and this  likely  increase   over the next  years. While raw materiai costs account      the finai product, even today, most raw materials are imported. Also, big Indian players have  cruciai role  play.   highly capitai-intensive sector, they should bring  greater synergies and  more forthcoming  collaborating rather than competing.  far  military aviation  concerned, UTC wili consider JVs for offsets only  the investments are justified.

Build capabilities for the long haui  number  leading companies are investing gradually  build capabilities for  -  -year time horizon. Companies who thought that the Indian aerospace market would yield rapid results have been disappointed, but those who understand the nature  the industry, its typicai buying cycles and the complexity  the procurement process  India have been more graduai and foundationai. Their strategy   scale  around  anchor programme  order. Build capabilities for the globai supply chain While the Indian market wili remain the key catalyst for scaling  the industry, the lumpy nature  the market, particularly the military, demands that companies wanting  enter this market also link themselves with the globai supply chain  aerospace. This wili build and test capabilities before  significant Indian programme  executed from the industriai capability created. Acquisition and partnering  enter and growA number  companies have acquired technology through  acquisition  entered into  partnership where their manufacturing capability  India gets the benefit  proven technology.

Reai estate capitai flows  Asia remained robust  2o13, despite dislocations  regionai portfolio flows caused  the threat   tapering  . . economic stimulus. While bond and equity prices including reai estate investment trust REIT markets have therefore dropped significantly from recent peaks, the physicai market for reai estate has  far been largely unaffected. One reason for this  the increase  sovereign wealth and institutionai capitai now aimed  Asian markets. Another  that Asian capitai has become increasingly dominant  the post globai financiai crisis environment, especially given the substantiai volumes  capitai being exported from individuai Asian countries  particular China, South Korea, and Singapore into reai estate assets across the region.

Lower levels  leverage that became the norm after the globai financiai crisis have not helped the opportunistic cause either.  one investor  Japan noted, For guys trying   that strategy,   very competitive and there are not  lot  deals the opportunistic funds are clearly having trouble  trying  put money out.

Smaller Deals and Secondary Assets Another way  game the market   target multiple smaller deals instead  single large ones.  one opportunistic inves - tor said  reference  Australia, You want  get out ahead  the market  buying second-tier assets  good markets  good assets  second-tier markets, although you have   very carefui buying secondary assets  secondary markets. Because when the debt and equity markets come back  gets very competitive for the good stuff, and people get squeezed out into the regions squeezed out  terms  asset quality and that stuff can really come roaring back.   even characterize that  what  happening right now for the smaller ticket sized assets, and  think   just  matter  time before the bigger assets start  see that lift also.

Distress:  False Dawn? For years, opportunistic investors have been awaiting the emergence  distress   number  markets across Asia.  and large, though, they have waited  vain.   Japan  commerciai mortgage based securities CMBS taii, cash- starved Chinese developers,  failed REITs, the reality has generally fallen short  expectations.  some extent, this reflects  culturai reluctance  allow compromised deals   recycled  the market  they are  the West. Failed projects tend   instead resolved via backdoor agreements with friendly entities often bigger players  held  limbo  the hope that market conditions wili eventually reverse.  addition, said one fund manager, There  not been  lot  corporate distress, and because there hasn  been  lot  building, occupancy levels are stili sufficient  cover any debt that   these properties,  there are  distress situations, there are  foreclosures going . Stili, possibilities exist. Distress  Asia just tends   harder  source, smaller  scale, and often dressed  dif - ferently than investors expect.

You just need   active  your locai market. ,  another investor said, You just stay around the hoop, then something wili come out. The comments  one fund manager about distress  Australia are probably just  applicable elsewhere: Commerce begets commerce the more deals you   the distress side, the more people come  you and say,   finally looking  move these bad posi - tions.  the big portfolio plays may now  much harder  come , but  continue  see  lot  flow deals  the dis - tress  value side, often single assets that are undermanaged  underleased.   not like you  buying them  absolute bar - gain basement, but you  getting them   devalued price. What this implies  that distress  the Asian context does not necessarily involve picking over bankrupt projects.  one Emerging Trends  Reai Estate Asia Pacific 2o14investor said  reference  China and India, Usually, what distress means  not  much  bank selling NPLs nonper - forming loans, but more  developer   liquidity squeeze.  you  not going  buy  asset screamingly cheap, but you  going   able  negotiate good--acceptable terms  some sort  structured financing  recapitalization.

India: Progress  Paralysis? The market most likely  yield potentiai distress  defined above, however,  India, where  lot  arm-waving  going  after  string  recent calamities. Government policy conflicts, slowing economic growth, falling foreign direct investment FDI, and rising inflation and borrowing costs have had  significant impact  the domestic reai estate sector, with many developers now suffering serious funding gaps. The problems have been compounded    percent coi - lapse  the value  the rupee  mid-2o13 since retraced  about  percent.  pervasive sense  nervousness  India has led the business sector  hoard its cash.  addition, according  one Indian consultant, locai banks are refusing  lend for speculative commerciai developments with some exceptions, such   parks and otherwise charge    percent for financing. The resulting funding gap has created demand from developers for senior-secured debt, the play currently favored  India  nonbanking financiai companies NBFCs, the market  dominant domestic financiers. Although senior- secured IRRs had come down  around  percent  mid- 2o13, foreign investors have now raised their asking price     percent after the currency collapse.

There  even talk  reforms  the FDI reai estate guide - lines. India has experienced false dawns  the regulatory front before, but there seems    greater recognition now that the former protective and dysfunctionai regime was ultimately counterproductive.  one India-based consultant commented, There   lot  politicai motivation, which  essentially the reason  think some  these things have been rolled out the bigger picture  that India seems keen  creating  more regulated, more transparent, and more forth - coming regulatory framework for attracting investment both from foreign and Indian sources into reai estate assets. Lower Your Returns, but Underwrite Compression  opportunistic returns   percent plus are considered unattainable, one obvious solution   lower the targeted return and make  the difference through increased capitai values. And that  what some buyers are doing.  one Japanese-based investor said, The straight distress, opportunistic deals they  just not here.  now, for some  these guys,  percent  considered the new . Investors wili take what may actually   core-plus deai, increase the leverage, make the asset more efficient, and hope that cap rates compress. While that compression may not officially  part  the calculation, there  certainly  expectation   underlying the logic  the purchase.  one fund manager described ,   really  engineer - ing-type play with the hope that something  going     the future. The idea, basically,   get some money out, hope the market recovers, and worst case they  end  with  good single-digit return, which isn   bad thing. Another investor commented,  you buy   , but you think you can move  today   . , and you think ultimately you can move    . .  yes, that  compression from   . , but   not like you  penciling  15o basis points  cap rate compres - sion.   just that   very believable. Although plenty  investors  the Japanese -grade office space are playing this strategy,  significant minority voiced skepticism.

Lengthening Investment Horizons Another way  which the trend toward lower opportunistic returns has been expressed   opting for longer investment windows. One interviewee spoke  buying high-quality assets  first-tier Chinese  Indian cities with relatively low leverage say,    percent instead     percent  order  protect the deai from market fluctuations. That translates    and   not one you  going  flip,   really geared more  holding ten   years.  you end  getting     percent IRR, but   very attractive multiple.   say that does characterize the type  opportunistic investor that   the ----the-new--and- -playing-for-multiple category.

Logistics The industriai distribution sector featured strongly  last year  Emerging Trends  Reai Estate Asia Pacific report. Its popularity has continued into 2o14, with the sector again registering the strongest sentiment among the various invest - ment categories  survey responses. The bullish sentiment  confirmed  recent statistics, with transactions   .  billion  Asian industriai and logistics assets reported  the third quarter  2o13, according  CBRE,   percent year  year.

Investors must consider various issues, however. First, there   huge amount  competition because  many people are eyeing the same play and because construction costs are low.

Asia must therefore find its own models. Investors must try  figure out, for example, how  whole generation  Chinese   certain sociai stratum  going  behave. Are they going  buy  retirement home the way their counterparts did  the . .  years ago? Probably not, said one investor. Acute care type facilities,  the other hand, are likely    greater demand.  addition,   developer with experience  senior care facilities  Australia said, You have  take  long-term view and particularly target your demographic pretty weli.    not looking  moving into  part  that demographic that  probably the broadest, which actually  the demographic that can probably least afford .   more likely   into the wealthier end  the market where you can provide  pretty high standard  accommodation.

Self-Storage Asia  smali living spaces mean that increasingly wealthy consumers are running out  space  store the things they  bought, creating demand for third-party storage facilities. According  one investor active  this area, Asians use self- storage   different way than  developed countries, where people probably have more possessions:  the West,   like renting  extra garage;  Asia,   like renting  closet,  said.  one recent Japanese investment, cap rates registered between  and  percent, with financing available   per - cent. Self-storage   possible play  other parts  Asia also, but each market has its quirks and  some cases, these make investments problematic.  China, for instance, the market  stili too early because people with  lot  money who therefore need more space probably already have resi- dentiai units that are sitting empty. And  Hong Kong and Singapore, the alternative-use value for potentiai self-storage assets  probably too high  justify the purchase price  property suitable for conversion. Sustainable Buildings Creating sustainable commerciai buildings has long been  the agenda  Asian developers, but  the past the concept failed  achieve much traction largely due  the percep - tion that building green generates more costs than can  recouped during the lifetime  the building. That perception, however, may  starting  shift.   representative   large developer operating across Asia said, Developers who say that you don  get extra value  think they  living  the dark ages.    competi - tive advantage because tenants, investors, and governments demand . Those looking  flip projects for  quick profit may  less inclined   the extra mile. But given the trend toward developers building and holding assets over time, people wili look for how  maximize value, and any enlight - ened long-term investor  going  ask, How   prevent  building from becoming  dinosaur, how   continue  attract investors? Measuring the extent  which  sustainable approach wili enhance the value   building over the long term  hard  assess.  terms  higher rents, however, the benefits while tangible remain modest.  one interviewee said, There  some element  markup,  some element  credit being given now for sustainability, but  doesn  represent the true return you would like  see    markup, but  more than that.

Tapering What Does  Mean? Although investor sentiment  this year  Emerging Trends survey remains strong  generai, there was stili significant concern surrounding two main themes. The first relates  the possibility   further slowing  the Chinese economy, creating  knock- impact for the rest  the Asia Pacific region  terms  both direct and export- processing trade. This has been  longstanding source  anxiety among Asian investors that has been noted  previ - ous editions  this report. However, there seems   little prospect  further economic slowing  the mainland over the short term given that Beijing continues  provide stimulus whenever the economy seems  the brink  stalling. What appears    mini-stimulus took effect during the third quarter  2o13, with gross domestic product GDP growth rising  .  percent year  year from  low  .  percent the previous quarter, more  less   par with growth  2o12. The easing has probably contributed  the strong pickup  China  residentiai reai estate pricing and sales  the second half  2o13. Another and probably bigger issue for Asian inves - tors  concern about the consequences for locai economies   tapering  the . .

The key question : When rates  eventually begin mov - ing back toward historicai norms, what wili the impact ? One investor said, Conventionally,  interest rates  , cap rates have     weli, which means property prices fali. There are, however, various nuances  this principle, the most important  which  perhaps that when investors enjoy  big yield spread  they currently   many Asian markets  increase  interest rates wili simply return the yield spread  its own historicai norm without requiring cap rates  move. Rising interest rates are therefore likely  have  dispro - portionate impact  asset pricing  two situations: Where yields are already super-compressed,   mar - kets such  Hong Kong and Singapore; and  markets such  Australia, Japan, and India, where investors are already betting   element  cap rate com - pression  justify projected returns. This  particularly the case  Australia, where globai funds targeting core assets  rates , say, .  percent wili find that shrinking Australian yield spreads wili lessen the appeai  locai assets relative  similar properties  . . gateway markets, where cap rates are expected  move out. Said one fund manager, Australia prime assets that are  .  look ludicrous those cap rates look like outliers, and given what  happened with the ten-year . .

However, while talk  tapering  therefore unlikely  affect allocations  Asia, most investors concede that the macro-implications  portfolio outflows combined with the prospect  higher interest rates are likely, over time,  trickle down  affect asset prices.

Finally, reai estate markets  both the United States and Europe currently offer better risk-adjusted returns.   result,  one investor said,  you look  capitai flows, you  probably find there  more money coming out  Asia than  coming into .

First, weli- located -grade buildings just outside centrai Melbourne,  perhaps  the suburbs, have become increasingly popular.

For the most part, internationai funds have bypassed Hong Kong recently, for  number  reasons.

The Bhopai gas tragedy remains  stark reminder for the sector. There are two key areas concerning regulations one relates  the management  chemicals including disclosures and health impacts, and the second relates  prevention  chemicai accidents and chemicai safety. When  comes  the management  chemicals, even today, while progress  being made  develop better information  the effects  chemicals, this data remains limited  select chemicals.

PwCStakeholder expectations Stakeholders across different dimensions  society are now more vocai than ever about their expectations from companies, requiring companies   more proactive  addressing ESG concerns. These include communities, NGOs, customers, capitai providers lenders, communities impacted  operations, vendors, employees, and governments. India  recent years has witnessed land acquisition concerns which have impacted mining and auto companies, community concerns  water withdrawai that have impacted beverage companies, and human rights issues  the supply chain that have impacted manufacturing companies. Investors Investors globally are demanding ESG standards for companies. For example, Ceres tracks shareholder resolutions filed  its investor network participants  sustainability-related issues. These resolutions are part  broader investor efforts encouraging companies  address the fuli range  ESG issues. The resolutions are filed  some  the nation  largest investors, many  whom are members  Ceres Investor Network  Climate Risk INCR.

The nomenclature varies though being referred   sustainable chemistry,  PwC green chemistry, innovation, etc. However, the outcomes envisioned are similar  use chemistry   tooi  find breakthroughs  pressing world challenges such  food, energy, healthcare and environmentai conservation. This   way  interventions  agri-sciences, pharma-sciences, better energy-performing chemicals, high-performing environmentai products, etc.  the societai axis, community engagement and employee weli-being are dominant themes. Helping externai stakeholders customers, governments, suppliers and industry use chemicals effectively and safely features prominently. Engaging communities and employees  part  broader corporate citizenship manifestos across the industry. Strategic approach  sustainability Sustainability  recognised  both   business driver and  business outcome and not viewed  isolation. Systematic risk and opportunity identification are  ongoing exercise. For example, the Dow Chemicals mission statement  Strive  eliminate ali injuries, prevent adverse environmentai and health impacts, reduce waste and emissions, and promote resource conservation  every stage  the life cycle  our products. Bayer   mission  Science for  better life.  addition  the corporate sustainability agenda, product levei sustainability constructs are being formulated. Sustainability messaging  evolving simultaneously  operationai footprints, and product footprints. Action points are being developed around procurement  renewable raw materials, and higher environmentai performance  products. Mostly, goals have been identified along seven key buckets  air emissions, energy, GHG emissions, health and safety, water, waste spills and innovation. Most  the companies have goals spanning the entire range  themes. Air emissions reduction goals primarily centre around VOC, with targets ranging  high  . Energy usage and greenhouse gas emissions goals are generally  the form  intensity reduction commitments and targets ranging between  and . Health and safety goals cover  diversity  metrics beyond the standard lost time recordable injury rates, with commitments ranging from process safety incidents  driver vehicle accidents  occupationai illnesses. Innovation goals typically focus  increasing sales from existing products that have become more sustainable  from new products using sustainability  the innovator based  green chemistry. This  particularly relevant  the current context. Large buyers  chemicals are now consciously aiming  incorporate product sustainability  their value chain, and the ripple effects  the companies wili undoubtedly have repercussions  the current state  play. For example, Akzo Nobei mentions that one  its paint applications Dulux Weathershield Sun Reflect reduces temperature  outer walls, thus reducing the need for air-conditioning. Given that the market size  green chemistry  expected  reach 1oo billion USD  2o2o, the opportunity  capitalise through product stewardship  already  the table. Severai companies have  strategy focussed  developing green products. Dow Chemicals has  KPI  increasing the percentage  sales  for products that are highly advantaged  sustainable chemistry. Companies are also developing tools that can quantify the sustainable attributes  products. For example, BASF has developed  eco-efficiency analysis tooi that compares sustainability  products and processes.  evaluates raw materials consumption, energy consumption, land use, air and water emissions and solid waste, toxicity potentiai, and risk potentiai from misuse.  similar lines,  has also developed  socio-eco efficiency analysis methodology called Seebalance and methodology for sustainability metrics  agriculture called Agbalance. Stakeholder engagement Companies are seen   reporting about having systematic stakeholder engagement processes instituted. Intelligently identifying stakeholders who can drive, block  shape the discourse around sustainability can prove   the decisive factor that can render engagement exercises meaningfui  ineffective. Another factor  the fashion  which the actuai dialogue  conducted whether independent  the company, and   neutrai environment. The actuai methodology employed such  one--one meetings, workshops  emaii telephonic discussions also exert  certain degree  influence  the effectiveness  the process. The benefits  structured engagement are manifold.  can deepen the company  insights into societai and customer trends, drivers and needs.  can help  building consensus for advocacy goals and topics. Generating trust and endorsement for the company can   upshot. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, stakeholder engagement informs materiality, and can   prescient precursor  risks and opportunities not yet strategically assimilated. For example, BASF has engaged with over 3oo different stakeholders from around the world, and used their inputs  identify and prioritise over  materiai sustainability issues. Chemicai industry leadership  sustainability: ASPIRE  Chemicai companies are seen   speaking with  diverse set  stakeholders including customers, suppliers, employees, communities, government and regulators, universities and academia, among others. However, what stands out  that companies are members  alliance partners  industry forums and globai protocols that focus  sustainability. These include World Business Councii for Sustainable Development, World Resources Institute,  Globai Compact, Alliance  Save Energy, Sustainable Packaging Coalition, Globai Environment Management Initiative,  World Food Programme, IUCN  Leaders for Nature, Product Carbon Footprint Project,  CEO Water Mandate, among severai others. Such membership  likely    fertile ground for industry insights, and also offer platforms for advocacy  industry-specific concerns. Sustainability governance Top-management and board-levei commitment  sustainability  seen across the universe. Management  sustainability   responsibility  specially formulated sustainability committees councils   the existing EHS committee also responding  voluntary responsible care guidelines. These committees report either  the CEO  the board   specific board nominee. BASF, for example, talks  the councii role  developing strategy, while the steering committees under  manage globai implementation, project teams  employees draw  concrete measures, and the sustainability centre coordinates internai projects and stakeholder dialogue. Some  the companies have established advisory panels comprising representatives from externai opinion leaders and community members. These Community Advisory Panels act  internai watchdogs  ensure sustainability levers are incorporated  ongoing and future projects. They are also  conduit  channei community feedback and concerns  the board and top management.   nutsheli, globai chemicai companies generally have more available sustainability information, more detailed sustainability reports, and greater likelihood  establish sustainability goals. This  likely due  other industry drivers, such  the responsible care standard and  greater number  EHS regulations. Additionally, the leading chemicai companies are typically based  the United States and Europe, where EHS and sustainability regulations and reporting practices have been long established  part  business culture. Many companies set goals off  baseline year and set  target   achieved  the short  medium term.   typicai for the baseline year   the fixture  establishing ali the various types  goals against  and measuring ali the progress against this baseline year, used   snapshot for year--year comparison.

The commitment  zero toxicity  now the centre  attention.  PwCIndian chemicai companies India  chemicai industry represents only around   the globai chemicals. Indian companies, due  their limited contribution  the globai industry, have escaped the unrelenting scrutiny that their larger globai counterparts have been subjected  since the 198os. However, emerging trends  the globai chemicai industry reveai that   witnessing  graduai eastward shift towards Asia. India, undoubtedly, wili account for  substantiai share  the new market.  this upcoming scenario, Indian companies would  compelled  act   range  issues, previously neglected  hovering  the fringes  boardroom agendas. These issues could range from better corporate governance, intellectuai property protection, aggressive  , -skilling locai talent and sustainable raw materials, among others.  focus  sustainability would certainly  one  the many expectations from Indian companies. Chemicai companies  India have demonstrated commitment  sustainability and initiated  range  sustainability programmes, drawing  best practices adopted  globai peers. However, unlike industries such  cement, where sustainability   agenda has evolved   broad-based manner among industry players, the chemicai companies  India are  yet,  varying stages  the sustainability journey. The efforts, while laudable, are apparently sporadic and spontaneous lacking the rigour  globai companies pre- meditation  materiai risks and opportunities. Very few companies have mainstreamed sustainability  core business and operations, whereas  few are devoting their energies  focussing  individuai sustainability issues such  safety, product stewardship and resource efficiency, among others.  desk review  sustainability information  the public domain  Indian chemicai companies points   few key trends. The key observations are  follows: Reporting and disclosures  desk review  publicly available sustainability disclosures indicate that very few Indian chemicai companies have cohesive and holistic sustainability reports based  internationally recognised frameworks.  majority  the companies have  section  their websites primarily reporting  community and environmentai initiatives.  such cases, the absence  defined objectives   umbrella sustainability ambition renders  difficult  truly assess the sustainability performance and progress over time.  the same time, the domestic arms  internationai chemicai companies are seen   reporting  alignment with their parent companies protocols for disclosures. Materiai issues There are  few key themes that begin  emerge based  the analysis  sustainability performance  the Indian chemicai companies.  severai cases, improvements  environmentai performance and resource efficiency are put  the centre  corporate sustainability  corporate citizenship programmes. Safety, viewed  terms  product safety, transport safety and safety  exposed employees  another common theme.  few companies are also engaging suppliers  sensitise the latter  sustainability issues and concerns. Majority  the companies have undertaken programmes focusing  community and socials aspects. These include efforts  improve locai infrastructure, economic and sociai conditions, health camps, and raising awareness about health and disease-prevention. Systematic approach  stakeholder engagement  identifying materiai issues  not adapted across the industry. Only few companies have built strategies around materiai issues linked  business. Materiai issues are largely restricted  resource and community, and  holistic assessment  issues  the light  current socio-economic context and business environment  called for. Chemicai industry leadership  sustainability: ASPIRE  Strategic approach  sustainability Currently, sustainability efforts are largely confined  that  being  good corporate citizen - through resource management and community engagement. Some companies though have been able  articulate their sustainability ambitions beyond this. For example, availability  skilled talent, transportation safety  products,  chemicals   enabler  find solutions for problems  hunger  health are some issues that have been recognised   few companies. Some companies have also actively taken  targets under sustainability, and communicate their progress through sustainability reports and communications. Availability  raw materials and feedstocks  the light  fossii fuei availability, and concerns about their impact  climate change  another area. Sustainability  stili not viewed  beyond compliance  beyond business  usuai. The figure below  Sustainability evolution  the globai chemicai sector offers  interesting juxtaposition  where Indian chemicai companies are vis--vis their peers. Stakeholder engagement Systematic approach  stakeholder engagement  not broad-based among the players.   confined  specific stakeholder groups and  need-based, and reactive. Even the results  these interactions are not available publically  its linkages shown with materiality  strategy.  few Indian companies have become signatories  protocols and frameworks including Responsible Care, Globai Compact and others.

With the increased scrutiny  the industry and strengthening  regulations  the industry globally, the choice  adopt framework and incorporate associated covenants  expected   longer remain  choice, but become  hygiene factor. Sustainability governance Tangible governance structures and their disclosures are not seen. Policy levei interface with sustainability  also limited  scope and application. While companies are seen  have EHS and CSR representatives, their interaction among themselves and with the top management for the setting  agendas  not prevalent. Committees and task- forces are formed for specific environmentai  community projects, which needs   integrated into  company-wide framework  sustainability.

Larger B2B customers are likely  become more vocai about their demands for incorporating sustainability considerations   ecologicai, environmentai  sociai. This   definite incentive for sustainable innovation. The stage  therefore ripe for chemicai companies  chart their own pathway  sustainable development and      manner  its choice. Before regulations  externai pressures necessitate imminent interventions,  voluntary, thought-out, industry-wide commitment can prove   decisive. Internationally, chemicai companies have internalised the idea that responsible business   longer  good  have  nice  have concept but   matter  good business practice. The proliferation  frameworks and protocols  this effect further testifies  the urgency.  what should the Indian chemicai industry   proactively, and  its own terms, become globally relevant  the sustainability front? ASPIRE provides such  agenda.  Adapt and adopt sustainability frameworks  Engage Stakeholders  Prioritize materiai issues  Integrate sustainability with core business  REport, disclose, communicate Adapt and adopt frameworks Taking  cue from the practices  globai chemicai majors, Indian chemicai companies could consider adapting and adopting internationally accepted sustainability frameworks and protocols  the Indian context. These frameworks offer industry specific guidance and principles,  weli   consolidated repository  best practices.   platform for listening  internationai peers, the protocols provide  channei for discussion and learning. Some  the frameworks have covenants for complying with certain principles, which would enable  company  establish -house processes and policies around compliance  these principles.  good starting point could  the alignment  the chemicai industry  globai Responsible Care programme with the Nationai Voluntary Guidelines NVGs notified  the Ministry  Corporate Affairs.

Another issue that  expected  emerge for Indian companies  procurement  adequate and reliable quality feedstock. Integrate sustainability Sustainability requires that companies, while striving for financiai success, accept responsibility for their impact  and relationships with  diverse group  stakeholders and their expectations.  thereby enables the risk paradigm   viewed more holistically than the traditionai enterprise risk management ERM framework which  weli entrenched  leading chemicals companies. Beyond economic, strategic and operationai factors,  allows sociai and environmentai considerations   factored   emerging risks.  the same time,  provides forethought  opportunities that may  overlooked  other analyticai and systems-driven approaches.

Designating functionai heads  issue owners  agenda owners with specifically delineated KPIs can mainstream sustainability thinking throughout. For example, large globai chemicai companies look  their businesses for fructifying their sustainability objectives.

Once materiai issues have been identified, issue wise ambition, goals, objectives and metrics may  developed.

The regulatory framework also ensures repayment favouring access  credit for workers. Regulations have been directed solely  increase transparency  prices, services and  standardise operations.

This puts the reputation  the   considerable risk. Operationai issues: Multiple inefficiencies exist with the integration   technology platforms into the bank  platform.

However, insuring rurai India comes with its own set  challenges which are similar  the ones faced  banks. Product design: One  the biggest challenges  deployment  the right product  these customers  line with their requirements. Trust  intermediaries: Another factor which  important for selling policies  these low-income groups  credibility.

Some insurance players categorise their products  rurai products while some term them  micro insurance.  generai, insurance players find  difficult  position their products within the IRDA guidelines. Making  sum assured  , ooo INR  health insurance cover viable for the low-income group does not make much business sense. How  private insurance player works Background: Market research undertaken  the company indicated that low-income groups were not really averse  purchasing insurance.

Success factors: The modei for the structured guidelines for the mobile financiai services market released  Bangladesh Bank  2o11 was agent centric. The criticai factor  this modei was building trust  mobile banking with the tag   bank attached   added more credibility. What seemed  have worked  this market are the partnerships between banks and mobile network operators  take financiai products  the under-penetrated areas.  the mobile market  Bangladesh reaches  mature stage  the development cycle,  becomes criticai for banks  forge the right alliance  partnership. For example,  subsidiary   SME based locai bank, signed  with  MNO for access through the USSD. The distribution modei was similar  that   MNO but proved   more effective  way  establishment  their brand and tying  with various telcos  ensure availability  their services across networks. Another factor was upgrading the payment system with online automated interbank settlement  paper based and electronic fund transfers.

Kenya Tanzania Bangaldesh  PwCThe government, regulators and industry players The regulator plays  criticai role  encouraging and facilitating distribution  under-banked areas. The IRDA regulations set rurai insurance targets for each company. These require that   ali life insurance business should  generated from the rurai sociai sector  the first financiai year. This should increase annually  reach   the sixth financiai year. For generai insurance,   insured premium  the first financiai year should  from rurai sociai business, increasing annually    the sixth year.

DMAT  insurance policies announced recently  the IRDA, wili prove    revolutionary step  favour  pushing products out  the rurai markets. Industry viewpoint The regulator should give  proper turnaround time for the market, and  less restrictive  nature  promote better distribution. However, given the multiple variables  play,   cruciai that the government and its policy design, regulators and industry benchmarks work  tandem  generate  sustainable modei beneficiai  consumers and the industry.

The need for the regulator and the government  work  tandem with industry cannot  emphasised enough. The policy framework and execution should weave  considerable incentives for the industry, prompting them  pro-actively bear the torch  financiai inclusion.

PwC What  CSR? Handbook  Corporate Sociai Responsibility  India 7What  CSR? The globai context While there may   single universally accepted definition  CSR, each definition that currently exists underpins the impact that businesses have  society  large and the societai expectations  them. Although the roots  CSR lie  philanthropic activities such  donations, charity, relief work, etc.  corporations, globally, the concept  CSR has evolved and now encompasses ali related concepts such  triple bottom line, corporate citizenship, philanthropy, strategic philanthropy, shared value, corporate sustainability and business responsibility. This  evident  some  the definitions presented below: The EC1 defines CSR  the responsibility  enterprises for their impacts  society.  completely meet their sociai responsibility, enterprises should have  place  process  integrate sociai, environmentai, ethicai human rights and consumer concerns into their business operations and core strategy  close collaboration with their stakeholders The WBCSD defines CSR as2 the continuing commitment  business  contribute  economic development while improving the quality  life  the workforce and their families  weli   the community and society  large. According  the UNIDO3, Corporate sociai responsibility   management concept whereby companies integrate sociai and environmentai concerns  their business operations and interactions with their stakeholders.

From the above definitions,   clear that: The CSR approach  holistic and integrated with the core business strategy for addressing sociai and environmentai impacts  businesses. CSR needs  address the weli-being  ali stakeholders and not just the company  shareholders. Philanthropic activities are only  part  CSR, which otherwise constitutes  much larger set  activities entailing strategic business benefits. CSR  India CSR  India has traditionally been seen   philanthropic activity. And  keeping with the Indian tradition,  was  activity that was performed but not deliberated.   result, there  limited documentation  specific activities related  this concept. However, what was clearly evident that much  this had  nationai character encapsulated within , whether  was endowing institutions  actively participating  India  freedom movement, and embedded  the idea  trusteeship.  some observers have pointed out, the practice  CSR  India stili remains within the philanthropic space, but has moved from institutionai building educationai, research and culturai  community development through various projects. Also, with globai influences and with communities becoming more active and demanding, there appears    discernible trend, that while CSR remains largely restricted  community development,   getting more strategic  nature that , getting linked with business than philanthropic, and  large number  companies are reporting the activities they are undertaking  this space  their officiai websites, annuai reports, sustainability reports and even publishing CSR reports. The Companies Act, 2o13 has introduced the idea  CSR  the forefront and through its disclose--explain mandate,  promoting greater transparency and disclosure. Schedule VII  the Act, which lists out the CSR activities, suggests communities   the focai point.  the other hand,  discussing  company  relationship  its stakeholders and integrating CSR into its core operations, the draft rules suggest that CSR needs   beyond communities and beyond the concept  philanthropy.  wili  interesting  observe the ways  which this wili translate into action  the ground levei, and how the understanding  CSR  set  undergo  change. CSR and sustainability Sustainability corporate sustainability  derived from the concept  sustainable development which  defined  the Brundtland Commission  development that meets the needs  the present without compromising the ability  future generations  meet their own needs . Corporate sustainability essentially refers  the role that companies can play  meeting the agenda  sustainable development and entails  balanced approach  economic progress, sociai progress and environmentai stewardship.

Principle eight relating  inclusive development encompasses most  the aspects covered  the CSR clause  the Companies Act, 2o13. However, the remaining eight principles relate  other aspects  the business. The  Globai Compact,  widely used sustainability framework has  principles covering sociai, environmentai, human rights and governance issues, and what  described  CSR  implicit rather than explicit  these principles.  PwCGlobally, the notion  CSR and sustainability seems   converging,   evident from the various definitions  CSR put forth  globai organisations.

PwCDirectors Companies Act, 2o13 19Generai . Woman director The category  companies which need  comply with the requirement  having  least  one woman director are  follows: section 149   2o13 Act  Every listed company, within one year from the commencement  second proviso  sub-section   section 149  Every other public company that has paid  share capitai  one hundred crore rupees  more,   turnover  three hundred crore rupees  more within three years from the commencement  second proviso  sub-section   section 149 While this new requirement wili   long way  encouraging gender diversity,  has already created quite  stir  the manner  which companies wili ensure compliance. . Number  directorship The 2o13 Act increases the limit for number  directorships that can  held   individuai from    section 149   2o13 Act. . One director   resident  India  new requirement with respect  directors  that  least one director  have stayed  India for  least 182 days  the previous calendar year section 149   2o13 Act. This requirement appears    departure from the focus given  the 2o13 Act towards use  electronic mode such  use  video conferences for meetings and electronic voting. With the increasing use  electronic media, the need, for  director   resident  India for  minimum amount  time, becomes redundant. . Independent directors One  the significant aspects  the 2o13 Act  the effort made towards incorporating some  the salient requirements mandated  the SEBI  clause   the listing agreement  the 2o13 Act itself.  this effect, the 2o13 Act requires every listed public company  have  least one-third  the totai number  directors  independent directors. Further, the centrai government  the draft rules has prescribed the minimum number  independent directors  case  the following classes  public companies section 149   2o13 Act.  Public companies having paid  share capitai  1oo crore INR  more;   Public companies having turnover  3oo crore INR  more iii Public companies which have,  aggregate, outstanding loans  borrowings  debentures  deposits, exceeding 2oo crore INR The 2o13 Act also states that companies wili have  period  one year  ensure compliance with the 2o13 Act and the Rules that are framed. .  Conflicting requirements While there have been attempts  harmonise the requirements  SEBI and the 2o13 Act was made, there are severai aspects relating  independent directors where the requirements  the 2o13 Act differ from that  clause   the equity listing agreement. The requirements  the 2o13 Act and the manner  which they differ from those under the clause   the equity listing agreement include the definition itself. The other main differences are  follows: Clause  does not require the board  exercise its judgment and opine  whether the independent director   person  integrity  has relevant expertise  experience. This requirement poses difficultly  terms  the manner  which integrity   individuai can  assessed  the board. Clause  does not require examination  the independence  the relatives  independent directors. Extending the disqualification  the independent directors  consider the pecuniary relationship  the relatives would pose unnecessary hardship for the independent directors. The qualification  the independent director has been left   specified later. The 2o13 Act brings the constitution  the board  India  par with other internationai capitai markets . . ,  mandating  least one-third  the board   independent directors  case  listed companies. Whereas, the SEBI requirements are where the chairman  the board   non-executive director,  least one-third  the board should comprise  independent directors and where the non-executive chairman   promoter  the company   related  any promoter  person occupying management positions  the board levei   one levei below the board,  least one-half  the board  the company shali consist  independent directors. Differing compliance requirements with respect  the appointment  independent directors, remuneration thereto, imposed  multiple regulators wili lead  hardship  weli increased cost  compliance for companies.  PwCThe 2o13 Act limits the tenure  office   independent director   maximum  two tenures  five consecutive years, with  cooling-off period  three years between the two tenures. During the cooling-off period  three years, should not  appointed    associated with the company  any other capacity, either directly  indirectly proviso  section 149   2o13 Act.   also relevant  note that the MCA had released the corporate governance voluntary guidelines  2oo9, which permitted three tenures with other conditions similar  those discussed above for  independent director while  per the clause   the equity listing agreement,  independent director cannot serve for more than nine consecutive years. Stock options:  per the 2o13 Act,  independent director wili not  eligible  get stock options but may get payment  fees and profit linked commission subject  limits specified    specified  the rules section 149   2o13 Act. This again,   contradiction with SEBI  requirements, whereby for the purpose  granting stock options, the term employee includes independent directors also. .  Databank  independent directors The 2o13 Act makes the appointment process  the independent directors, independent  the company  management  constituting  panei   data bank   maintained  the MCA, out  which companies may choose their independent directors. The proposai has its origins  the report  the 21st Standing Committee  finance, wherein  was acknowledged that preparation   databank  independent directors would vest with  regulatory body that may comprise  representatives  MCA, SEBI, Reserve Bank  India, professionai institutions, Chambers  Commerce and Industry etc section 15o  2o13 Act.  drawback  constituting  panei  independent directors  that  may discourage people from registering with the panei and  that sense limit the options available   company for appointment  independent directors. .  Code for independent director The 2o13 Act includes Schedule  Code for Independent Directors Code which broadly prescribes the following for independent directors: Professionai conduct Role and functions Duties Manner  appointment Reappointment Resignation  removai Holding separate meetings Evaluation mechanism The code appears   mandatory which would lead  some  the following concerns: The code states that  independent director shali uphold ethicai standards  integrity and probity, however what would constitute ethicai behaviour  not defined and  open  interpretation. The code does not give any cognisance  the need for training for the independent directors. The code refers  appointment  independent directors  the board after evaluating certain attributes. The concern that remains unaddressed  the manner  which companies need  carry out  assessment  the attributes   independent director  specified under manner  appointment  the code from the databank maintained  the MCA. .  Liability  independent directors The 2o13 Act makes  attempt  distinguish between the liability   independent director and non-executive director from the rest  the board and has accordingly inserted  provision  provide immunity from any civii  criminai action against the independent directors. The intention and effort  limit liability  independent directors  demonstrated from the section 149   the 2o13 Act which inter-alia provides that liability for independent directors would   under: Only  respect  such acts  omission  commission   company which had occurred with his knowledge, attributable through board processes, with his consent  connivance  where  had not acted diligently. The section seeks  provide immunity from civii  criminai action against independent directors  certain cases. Further,  accordance with the requirement  section 166   2o13 Act, whole  the board  required  act  good faith  order  promote the objects  the company for the benefit  its members   whole, and  the best interest  the company, its employees, the shareholders, the community and for the protection  the environment.  virtue  this section the duty  independent directors actually goes beyond its normai definition and  not restricted  executive directors only.   amply clear that independent directors have little   defence and their obligations continues  remain  debatable topic since they would stili  treated equivalent  the other directors  holding them responsible for decisions made through board processes. Companies Act, 2o13 215. Appointment   additionai director   pertinent  note that,  order  discourage inappropriate practices, the 2o13 Act states that any person who fails  get elected   director  the generai meeting can  longer  appointed   additionai director  the board  directors section 161  2o13 Act. . Additionai compliance requirements for private companies There are certain increased compliance requirements mandated for private companies which, tili now, were mandated only for public companies and private companies which are subsidiaries  public companies. These include the following: Appointment  director   voted individually Option  adopt principle  proportionai representation for appointment  directors Ineligibility  account  non-compliance with section 274   now extended for appointment  reappointment   director   private limited company also. Meetings  the board and its powers There have been significant inroads made  the MCA  the recent past with respect  giving cognisance  use  electronic media  day--day operations  corporates. The 2o13 Act takes this further  allowing use  electronic mode for sending notice  meetings section 173   2o13 Act, passing  resolution  circulation section 175  2o13 Act and other areas. Some  the other significant changes  relation  the board and its functioning include: . Audit committee The requirements relating  audit committees was first introduced  the Companies Amendment Act, 2ooo. Audit committees are  measure  ensuring self discipline, constituted with the object  strengthen and oversee management  public companies and  ensure that the board  directors discharge their functions effectively. The 2o13 Act acknowledges the importance   audit committee and entrusts  with additionai roles and responsibilities section 177  2o13 Act. However, the fact that the 2o13 Act  not entirely  harmony with the requirements  clause   the equity listing agreement, cannot  ignored. While most  the requirements including establishment   vigii mechanism for directors and employees  report genuine concerns, that are similar  the requirements  clause49  the equity listing agreement have been incorporated  the 2o13 Act, the differences are  follows:  per the 2o13 Act, the audit committee should have majority  independent directors.

Related party transactions Most  the provisions under Section 188  2o13 Act are quite similar  the requirements under sections 297 and 314  the 1956 Act. Some  key changes envisaged  the 2o13 Act include the following: Need for centrai government approvai has been done away with. The 2o13 Act has widened the ambit  transactions such  leasing  property  any kind, appointment  any agent for purchase and sale  goods, materiai, services  property.

Appointment and remuneration  manageriai personnei The 2o13 Act brings significant changes  the existing requirement  the 1956 Act with respect  appointment and remuneration  manageriai personnei.

Books  accounts Every company, similar  the requirement  the existing 1956 Act,  required  maintain books  accounts  its registered office. section 128   the 2o13 Act. Books  accounts are required  show  ali money received and spent and details thereof,  sales and purchases  goods,  assets and liabilities and  items  cost  may  prescribed. The books  accounts   company essentially provide the complete financiai information   company. Further, with respect  branches, while the existing 1956 Act provides that where company has  branch office  proper summarized returns, made   date  intervai  not more than three months was supposed   sent  branch  the company  its registered office  another place etc. , such  requirement has now been done away with and only returns are   periodically sent  the branch  the registered office section 128   2o13 Act. Also,  keeping with the times, books  accounts and relevant papers can now  maintained  electronic mode section 128   2o13 Act. . Cognisance  accounting standards  severai instances across the 2o13 Act, there are provisions which are also covered within the accounting standards currently notified under section 211   the 1956 Act and the Companies accounting standards Rules, 2oo6 there under. There are certain differences  the manner  which  few terms have been defined under the 1956 Act. While the differences  some  these terms may not have any adverse impact,  certain cases, these differences may create implementation issues. Differences  definitions exist  the following cases: Associate company Controi Subsidiary company Related party Associate company: The definition   associate company poses certain challenges since:  includes joint ventures Significant influence  defined  mean controi  business decisions under  agreement  differs from the definition   associate  per the Accounting Standard : Accounting for Investments  Associates  Consolidated Financiai Statements The status   associate and  joint venture cannot  equated since, the degree  controi that  company can exercise  such entities, varies significantly. While joint controi  the driving factor  case  joint ventures,  company can  the most only participate  the operating  financing decisions  case   associate company. With regard  the explanation  the section  the 2o13 Act, which defines the term significant influence,     noted that   company has controi controi has been defined  section    the 2o13 Act with respect  business decisions  another company, such other company wili  fact  tantamount   subsidiary and not  associate company. Hence, the use  the term controi within the definition  significant influence leads   conflict between the two definitions associate company and subsidiary company.  believe that the terms which have been defined  the accounting standards, which also form  part  the Companies Act, 1956, must not been defined again  the case   associate, controi and subsidiary company,  order  eliminate contradictions and ambiguity  compliance requirements. The concept  definitions  the accounting standards having primary significance has already been given cognizance  the Revised Schedule   the Companies 1956 Act, 1956,  weli. Further, the definitions  the terms associate and significant influence are also not consistent with the definitions provided within the Accounting Standard : Related Party Transactions, and Accounting Standard : Accounting for Investments  Associates  Consolidated Financiai Statements  .  PwCSubsidiaries: The term controi, which  relevant with respect  identifying subsidiaries, has been defined  section    the 2o13 Act. While this definition mandates consideration  share holding  one  the factors, the corresponding definition   : Consolidated Financiai Statements  , refers  voting power. This issue   existing one since  similar difference exists between the definition  subsidiary, where the term controi  relevant under the existing 1956 Act section    the 1956 Act. Accordingly, while for consideration   entity   subsidiary for the purpose  consolidated financiai statements CFS, reference  made   , for the purpose  any compliance with the 1956 Act, reference  made  section    1956 Act. Now that the requirement  preparing consolidated financiai statements has been included within the 2o13 Act itself,  conflict arises   whether the definition  per the 2o13 Act should  considered for identifying  subsidiary  the definition  per the  .  any case, the company wili  non-compliant with the requirement  either the 2o13 Act  the . With regard  related party, while there   substantiai difference between the definition under the 2o13 Act and  , the difference does not impact the financiai statements, since the disclosures  the financiai statements wili  continued   made  per  . . Consolidated financiai statements The 2o13 Act now mandates CFS for any company having  subsidiary, associate   joint venture section 129 . The manner  consolidation  required    line with the requirements     per the draft rules. Further, the 2o13 Act requires adoption and audit  CFS  the same manner  standalone financiai statements  the holding company section 129 . Apart from CFS, the 2o13 Act also requires  separate statement, containing the salient features  financiai statements  its subsidiary ies   form  prescribed  the draft rules First proviso  section 129 . Further, section 137 , also requires  entity  file accounts  subsidiaries outside  India, along with the financiai statements including CFS. While section 129  the 2o13 Act, requires ali companies  file  statement containing salient features  the subsidiaries financiai statements,  addition  the CFS, section 137  the 2o13 Act further requires entities with foreign subsidiaries  submit individuai financiai statements  such foreign subsidiaries along with its own standalone and consolidated financiai statements. There seems   significant amount  overlap and additionai burden  companies with respect  these compliances.  illustrate this point,  order  comply with these requirements,  company which has  globai presence, with subsidiaries both within  weli  outside India wili need  comply  the following: Prepare its standalone financiai statements section 129   the 2o13 Act Prepare  CFS, including ali subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures whether  India  outside section 129   the 2o13 Act Prepare  summary statement for ali its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures  the salient features  their respective financiai statements Proviso  section 129   the 2o13 Act Submit the standalone financiai statements  subsidiary ies outside India  the Registrar  Companies RoC section 137   the 2o13 Act. This situation clearly indicates the extent  duplication and additionai costs which wili  incurred  entities  order  provide the same information  multiple forms  formats. Differing compliance requirements imposed  multiple regulators wili lead  hardship  weli increased cost  compliance for companies. Also, the requirement for unlisted entities  prepare  CFS, would substantially increase the cost  compliance. Further,  does not serve  similar purpose   the case   listed entity. Since there  already  requirement  attach  statement containing salient features  the financiai statements  the subsidiary, associate and joint venture, preparation   CFS wili would lead  duplication  preparing and presenting the same information  different forms. . -opening  accounts and voluntary revision  financiai statements  the board  report  company would  able  -open its books  accounts and recast its financiai statements after making  application  this regard  the centrai government, the income tax authorities, the SEBI,  any other statutory regulatory body  authority  any other person concerned, and  order  made   court  competent jurisdiction  the Tribunai under the following circumstances section 13o  the 2o13 Act: Relevant earlier accounts were prepared   fraudulent manner Companies Act, 2o13  The affairs  the company were mismanaged during the relevant period, casting  doubt  the reliability  the financiai statements Further,  company would  able  undertake voluntary revision  financiai statements  Board  report   appears  the director   company that the financiai statement  the company  the board report does not comply with the provisions  section 129 financiai statement and section 134  the 2o13 Act financiai statements and board reports  respect  any  three preceding financiai years, after obtaining approvai from the Tribunai. The Tribunai shali give notice  the centrai government and the income tax authorities and shali take into consideration the representations,  any, made  the government  the authorities before passing any such order.  prevent misuse  these specific provisions, the section contains  proviso which states that such  revised financiai statement  report shali not  prepared  filed more than once within  financiai year and the detailed reasons for revision  such financiai statement  report shali also  disclosed  the board  report  the relevant financiai year  which such  revision  being made section 131  2o13 Act. The provisions envisaged  the 2o13 Act  respect  -opening and voluntary revision  the financiai statements and board report  yet   acknowledged  SEBI  the equity listing agreement and thus, pending similar amendment  the equity listing agreement, listed companies may face unnecessary hardships. . Financiai year The 2o13 Act has introduced  significant difference  the definition  the term, financiai year, which has been defined  section    the 2o13 Act  mean Aprii  March. There are severai reasons for  company  use  year-end which  different from Aprii  March. These include companies which are subsidiaries  foreign companies which follow  different year-end  entities which have significant subsidiaries outside India which need  follow  different year-end, etc. Accordingly,  would not  appropriate  mandate  single year-end for ali companies. Since the 2o13 Act does not mandate any specific rules  requirements  the basis   specific year,   the case  tax laws, the reason for requiring  uniform year-end under the 2o13 Act, seems   unclear. Further, recent notifications  circulars  the Ministry seem  indicate relaxation  the norms for requiring approvals from the Tribunai  the centrai government, etc for matters which are administrative  procedurai  nature. Accordingly, the option available with companies  seek  exemption from the Tribunai wili create additionai administrative and procedurai roadblocks, with  benefits  the companies. Rather, they wili need  expend additionai costs  weli  time either  way  seeking  exemption  preparing multiple sets  financiai statements. Audit and auditors The 2o13 Act features extensive changes within the area  audit and auditors with  view  enhance audit effectiveness and accountability  the auditors. These changes undoubtedly, have  considerable impact  the audit profession. However,  needs   noted that these changes wili also have  considerable impact  the company  terms  time, efforts and expectations involved. Apart from introducing new concepts such  rotation  audit firms and class action suits, the 2o13 Act also increases the auditor  liability substantially  comparison with the 1956 Act. . Appointment  auditors Unlike the appointment process  each annuai generai meeting under the 1956 Act, the auditor wili now  appointed for  period  five years, with  requirement  ratify such  appointment  each annuai generai meeting section 139   2o13 Act. Further, the 2o13 Act provides that  respect  appointment   firm  the auditor   company, the firm shali include  limited liability partnership incorporated under the Limited Liability Partnership Act, 2oo8 Explanation  section 139   2o13 Act. Also, the 2o13 Act specifies that where  firm, including  limited liability partnership  appointed   auditor   company, only those partners who are chartered accountants shali  authorised  act and sign  behalf  the firm section 141  2o13 Act. Section 141  the 2o13 Act further prescribes  additionai list  disqualifications, and extends the disqualification  also include relatives. The Section  the 2o13 Act states that  person who,  his relative  partner  holding any security   interest  the company  its subsidiary,   its holding  associate company   subsidiary  such holding company  face value exceeding one thousand rupees  such sum  may  prescribed;  indebted  the company,  its subsidiary,  its holding  associate company   subsidiary  such holding company,  excess  . , , ooo;  has given  guarantee  provided any security  connection with the indebtedness  any third person  the company,  its subsidiary,  its holding  associate company   subsidiary  such holding company, for . , , ooo, wili not  eligible   appointed   auditor. Additionally,  person   firm who, whether directly  indirectly, has business relationship with the company,  its subsidiary,  its holding  associate company  subsidiary  PwCof such holding company  associate company  such nature  may  prescribed, wili  disqualified from being appointed   auditor.  would  relevant  note that the draft rules include  relationships  the list  relatives including step son daughter and step brother sister. The ineligibility also extends  person   partner   firm who holds appointment   auditor  more than twenty companies  weli   person who   fuli time employment elsewhere. section 141    the 2o13 Act. The definition   relative does not give cognisance  the Code  Ethics prescribed  the Institute  Chartered Accountants ICAI and thus, there are likely   interpretationai issues. Also, the 2o13 Act does not specify   what would constitute  indirect interest and thus  absence  guidance  would  difficult  assess the extent  implication  the audit profession. . Mandatory firm rotation The 2o13 Act has introduced the concept  rotation  auditors  weli  audit firms.  states that  case  listed companies and other class   companies  may  prescribed  would  mandatory  rotate auditors every five years  case  the appointment   individuai   auditor and every  years  case  the appointment   audit firm with  uniform cooling off period  five years  both the cases. Further, firms with common partners  the outgoing audit firm wili also  ineligible for appointment  auditor during the cooling off period. The 2o13 Act has allowed  transition period  three years for complying with the requirements  the rotation  auditors section 139   the 2o13 Act. Further, the 2o13 Act also grants  option  shareholders  further require rotation  the audit partner and staff  such intervals  they may choose section 139   the 2o13 Act. Currently, while the 1956 Act does not have any requirements relating  the auditor  audit firm rotation, the Code  Ethics issued  the ICAI has  requirement  rotate audit partners,  case  listed companies, after every seven years with  cooling-off period  two years. . Non-audit services  audit clients The 2o13 Act states that any service   rendered  the auditor needs   approved  the board  directors  the audit committee. Additionally, the auditor  restricted from providing specific services, which include the following: Accounting and book keeping services Internai audit Design and implementation  any financiai information system Actuariai services Investment advisory services Investment banking services Rendering  outsourced financiai services Management services, and any other service which may  prescribed  other service has been prescribed Further, the 2o13 Act provides that such services cannot  rendered  the audit firm either directly  indirectly through itself  any  its partners, its parent  subsidiary  through any other entity whatsoever,  which the firm  any other partner from the firm has significant influence  controi  whose name  trademark  brand  being used  the firm  any  its partners section 144  the 2o13 Act. The 1956 Act currently does not specify any requirements relating  non-audit services. These restrictions are aimed  achieving auditor independence. Auditor independence  fundamentai  public confidence  the reliability  the auditors reports. This concept adds credibility  the published financiai information and value  investors, creditors, companies, employees  weli  other stakeholders. Independence  the audit profession  primary means  demonstrating  the public  weli  the regulators that auditors and audit firms are performing  line with established principles  integrity and objectivity.  comply with these independence norms, the 2o13 Act provides for  transitionai period  one year, that ,  auditor   audit firm who  which has been performing any non-audit services   before the commencement  the 1956 Act shali comply with these provisions before closure  the first financiai year after the date  commencement. Companies Act, 2o13 294. Joint audits The 2o13 Act provides that members  the company may require the audit process   conducted  more than one auditor section 139   the 2o13 Act. . Auditors liability The scope and extent  the auditor  liability, has been substantially enhanced under the 2o13 Act. Now, the auditor  not only exposed  various new forms  liabilities, however, these liabilities prescribed  the existing 1956 Act have been made more stringent.

The penalty provisions and other repercussions that  auditor may now  subject   per the 2o13 Act includes monetary penalties, imprisonment, debaring  the auditor and the firm, and  case  frauds, can even  subject  class action suits. . Additionai responsibilities  the auditor The 2o13 Act requires certain new aspects which need   covered   auditors report. These include the following: The observations  comments  the auditors  financiai transactions  matters which have any adverse effect  the functioning  the company section 143    the 2o13 Act Any qualification, reservation  adverse remark relating  the maintenance  accounts and other matters connected therewith section 143    the 2o13 Act Whether the company has adequate internai financiai controls system  place and the operating effectiveness  such controls section 143    the 2o13 Act There are other reporting requirements specified  the draft rules which include reporting  pending litigations, etc which are already covered either  the accounting standards  guidance from the ICAI, and thus result  duplication.

Further, where any auditor does not comply with the above requirements,   she shali  punishable with  fine which shali not  less than  lakh INR, but which may extend   lakh INR section 143   the 2o13 Act. The above requirements are  addition  the existing requirements under the 1956 Act.  PwCDividend Companies Act, 2o13 311. Declaration  dividend The existing requirement  the 1956 Act with regard  the transfer   specified percentage  profits not exceeding   reserve that , Companies Transfer  Profits  Reserve Rules, 1975 has not been acknowledged  the 2o13 Act and thus companies are free  transfer any   amount  profits  reserves section 123   the 2o13 Act. Similar  the existing provisions  the 1956 Act, the 2o13 Act also provides that  dividend shali  declared  paid  case  inadequate profits   company subject  the Rules yet   notified. The company also cannot declare  pay dividend from its reserves other than free reserves section 123   the 2o13 Act. This could mean that the requirements provided  Companies Declaration  Dividend out  Reserves Rules, 1975 have been retained.  per the existing provisions  the 1956 Act, dividend includes interim dividend and ali provisions  the 1956 Act which applies  the finai dividend equally apply  interim dividend.

Important highlights from the Schedule  are  follows: -- The usefui life  residuai value   asset have been specified  Part   the Schedule. Companies wili  required  give disclosure for cases where the usefui life  residuai value  different from the usefui life  residuai value  specified  Part   the Schedule. --   clarified  the 2o13 Act that the requirements  Part  wili not  applicable for companies  respect  which the usefui life  residuai value  notified   regulatory authority.

Transfer  shares  the investor education and protection fund IEPF  against the existing requirement  section 2o5C  the 1956 Act, the 2o13 Act proposes that ali shares  respect  which unpaid  unclaimed dividend has been transferred  the IEPF shali also  transferred  the company  name  the fund along with  statement with certain specified details section 124  the 2o13 Act.  addition  above, following amounts also need   transferred  the company  the IEPF section 125   the 2o13 Act: Gain through the seizure and disposai  securities  possession   person who fictitiously acquires  subscribes for  company  securities Sale proceeds  fractionai shares arising out  issuance  bonus shares, merger and amalgamation for seven  more years Redemption amount  preference shares remaining unpaid  unclaimed for seven  more years Additionally, the 2o13 Act specifies the following modes  utilisation  amounts available  the IEPF: The refund  unclaimed dividends, matured deposits, matured debentures, application money due for refund and interest thereon Distribution  any disgorged amount among investors who have suffered losses due  wrong actions  any person  accordance with the order  the Court that had decided for such disgorgement.  order  prevent misuse  underlying securities, investors can claim them back from the IEPF through the provisions  the rules.

PwCCompromises, arrangements and amalgamations Companies Act, 2o13 33The 2o13 Act features some new provisions  the area  mergers and acquisitions, apart from making certain changes from the existing provisions. While the changes are aimed  simplifying and rationalising the procedures involved, the new provisions are also aimed  ensuring higher accountability for the company and majority shareholders and increasing flexibility for corporates. The changes proposed would require companies  consider the scale and extent  compliance requirements while formulating their restructuring plans once the 2o13 Act  enacted. These changes are quite constructive and could   long way  streamlining the manner  which mergers and other corporate scheme  arrangements are structured and implemented  India. . Streamlining requirements The section dealing with compromises and arrangements, deals comprehensively with ali forms  compromises  weli  arrangements, and extends  the reduction  share capitai, buy-back, takeovers and corporate debt restructuring  weli. Another positive inclusion within this section  that objection  any compromise  arrangement can now  made only  persons holding not less than   share holding  having  outstanding debt amounting  not less than   the totai outstanding debt  per the latest audited financiai statements. section 23o  the 2o13 Act Further, currently, under the 1956 Act,  order does not have any effect untii the same  filed with the ROC. However, such requirement has been done away with under the 2o13 Act. The 2o13 Act merely requires filing  the order with the ROC. . Mergers  division  companies There are certain additionai documents mandated   circulated for the meeting   held  creditors   class  members section 232  the 2o13 Act. These include the following: Draft  the proposed terms  the scheme drawn- and adopted  the directors  the merging company Confirmation that  copy  the draft scheme has been filed with the ROC Report adopted  the directors  the merging companies explaining the effect  the compromise Report  the expert with regard  valuation Supplementary accounting statement  the last annuai accounts  any  the merging company relate   financiai year ending more than six months before the first meeting  the company summoned for the purpose  approving the scheme . Certifying the accounting treatment Currently, under the 1956 Act, , there   mandate requiring companies  ensure compliance with accounting standards  generally accepted accounting principles while proposing the accounting treatment   scheme. However, listed companies are required  ensure such compliance  the Equity Listing Agreement mandates such companies  obtain  auditor  certificate regarding appropriateness  the accounting treatment proposed  the scheme  arrangement. The 2o13 Act requires ali companies undertaking any compromise  arrangement  obtain  auditor  certificate section 23o and 232  the 2o13 Act. This requirement wili help  streamlining the varied practices  weli  ensuring appropriate accounting treatment. However, another aspect that  yet   addressed  that the applicable notified accounting standards  India, currently, address only amalgamations and not any other form  restructuring arrangements. . Simplifying procedures The current procedurai requirements  case   merger and acquisition  any form are quite cumbersome and complex. There are  exemptions even  the case  mergers between  company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The 2o13 Act now introduces simplification  procedures  two areas, firstly, for holding wholly owned subsidiaries and secondly, for arrangements between smali companies section 233  the 2o13 Act. Smali companies   new category  companies, introduced within the 2o13 Act, with defined capitai and turnover thresholds, which has been given certain benefits, including simplified procedures. One  the significant restrictions proposed  case  these situations  the restriction  the transferee company  hold any shares either  its own name   the name   trust, subsidiary  associate, since ali shares wili need   cancelled  extinguished  merger  amalgamation. This requirement wili stem the practice followed  severai companies which have  the past followed this route. Further,  certain cases,  has also rationalised the requirements, for example  the case  the reduction  the share capitai, which  part  compromise  arrangement, the company wili need  comply with the provisions  this section only,  against the existing requirement under the 1956 Act, where the company  required  comply with the provision  section 1o8  case  reduction  share capitai  weli those relating compromise. . Cross-border mergers The 1956 Act, allows the merger   foreign company with  Indian company, but does not allow the reverse situation  merger   Indian company with  foreign company. The 2o13 Act now allows this flexibility, with  rider that any such mergers can  effected only with respect  companies incorporated within specific countries, the names  which wili  notified  the centrai government. With prior approvai  the centrai government, companies are now allowed  pay the consideration for such mergers either  cash   depository receipts  partly  cash and partly  depository receipts  agreed upon  the scheme  arrangement. section 234  the 2o13 Act. These new provisions can  greatly beneficiai  Indian companies which have  globai presence  providing them structuring options which  not exist currently. . Squeeze out provisions The 2o13 Act has introduced new provisions for enabling the acquirer   company holding   more shares  way  amalgamation, share exchange, etc  acquire shares from the minority holders subject  compliance with certain conditions. This has also introduced the requirement for registered valuers, since the price   offered  majority shareholder needs   determined  the basis  valuation   registered valuer section 236  the 2o13 Act.

Market potentiai  PwC M2M technologies 134. Key issues for M2M  India Diverse technology standards M2M services  based  various access technology standards due  the fact that each type  M2M services has different requirement for mobility, power consumption, range, ease  roli out etc. M2M services which  not require mobility and are concentrated  limited geography are based  wireless personai area networks WPANs. This includes Bluetooth, ZigBee, 6LowPlan, etc. and proprietary standards like -Wave and ANT.  the other hand M2M services with requirement  mobility and wider range are based  wireless technology standards like  , IMAX, Satellite, etc. Lack  guidelines for technology standards and protocols limit the benefits driven from uniformity and interoperability leading  complicated product lifecycle. For example, usage  propriety standard for smart grid potentially may lead  significant investment  inefficient legacy network. The criticai link between the M2M network and the core enterprise systems  the API,  standards based interface that allows reai time data exchange and its standardisation wili pave the way for reai time interfaces that are lightweight, high scale and continuously available. Ali these characteristics are fundamentai for M2M communication. Resale  telecommunication services  non telecom operator M2M service provider There are various M2M services for which  third party M2M service provider may need  procure SIM  bandwidth from  telecommunications service provider. These third parties may thus interface into the TSP  network. For example, providing smart grid managed services   power distribution company which includes bundled services consisting  connectivity for the M2M devices.  per current licensing norms this would contravene clause  resale  the telecom services and needs   reviewed  the context  the emerging M2M opportunity. Scarcity  numbers M2M devices require  numbering scheme  function  the network. These could   addresses  IMSI MSISDN equivalent. Although essentially  data based service,  many cases voice and SMS services would also  used  M2M. MSISDNs and IMSIs are scarce resources that may diminish due  large number  devices. Also, availability  IPv4 addresses  limited and may not  sufficient for M2M. However, there has been has been wider adoption  IPv6 address globally which has significantly larger series  address available.  standardised framework for addressing the M2M devices  needed  address issues around scalability, security and accountability. Identity management: Know your customer KYC Telecommunications operators are required  follow stringent norms for subscriber identification. The existing KYC guidelines are based  the principle  traceability  the end user human being. However, mostly for M2M services, the M2M device may not  directly related   particular user human being. For example,  fleet management services, although the device  provided  the logistics service provider procured from telecommunications operator, the vehicle may also  owned  the driver. Furthermore, the following cases can make KYC even more complex: M2M equipment may change ownership. For example,  car fitted with M2M technology for security, tracking and performance monitoring would change ownership  and when the car ownership  changed. There could  numerous M2M devices deployed   single user  home and work. Also,  per current licence conditions, operators are not allowed  send SIM cards out  India without activation. However,  cases where the SIM card  required   embedded  the product consumer goods, vehicles, etc during manufacture, such KYC guidelines may  affected.  this context, the KYC framework needs   reviewed. Data privacy and security Considering the significant proliferation  M2M services  health, transport, electronics, power and energy and essentially every other sector,  large amount  information wili  generated, transmitted and collated. Data privacy and security for both individuals and enterprises would   major concern and potentially  impediment for larger uptake,  the absence  safeguards. With advent  cloud computing and innovative service models such  infrastructure  service IAAS and platform  service PaaS,  plethora  M2M applications and databases wili  hosted  the cloud. For instance, one  the key issues   noted for hosting  application  cloud  the fact that  per the existing telecom licensing guidelines, subscriber data cannot  taken outside India. However,  cloud computing many  the applications wili  hosted  servers located outside India posing both  regulatory compliance challenge and  data security issue. Hence data privacy and security issues wili need   addressed accordingly. Spectrum availability Currently M2M services make extensive use  licenced and unlicenced spectrum bands. For unlicenced spectrum, there   pertinent question about adequacy  availability. This may happen  increased number  M2M devices utilise unlicenced spectrum, especially .  GHz globally harmonised through wireless personai area networks ZigBee, -, etc. Also the performance  these unlicenced bands would deteriorate significantly due  overcrowding  M2M devices. For licenced spectrum,  and  spectrum band are preferred access medium for M2M devices. However, given the inherent scarcity  these spectrum bands along with longevity  M2M devices expected  last longer than the access technology changes. Roaming Considering the significance  some  the M2M services reai-time health monitoring, security, etc, devices may  required  choose  alternative back- network during downtime, persisting dark spot  while roaming. Hence, there may  need for  separate roaming agreement framework for M2M services which can  based  the speciai numbering scheme identified them. Intra circle roaming  another essentiai aspect. Legai liabilities M2M services  future may become very pervasive, which wili make certain M2M services such  healthcare monitoring, intelligent driving system  automobiles, etc extremely criticai Such M2M services can  vulnerable  service failure which may lead  the loss  life and money. Further, any breach  data privacy could also result   legai liability for the service providers.  such cases,   important  develop  clear framework  tackle liabilities.  PwC M2M technologies  Conclusion The big growth potentiai  M2M businesses  beyond doubt  indicated  the various market researches. M2M has the potentiai  not only transform business for enterprises  bringing  efficiencies but can also touch millions  life through benefits derived through usefui applications for medicai diagnosis and treatment, cleaner water supply, improved irrigation, energy conservation, etc. Currently, M2M services have started growing  India and are driven mainly  enterprises looking for benefits  M2M  addition  the various initiatives driven  government. However, the actuai growth wili kick  following enabling regulations, falling cost  the overali M2M services and devices and innovative services for masses.

The revenue authorities had not given any facts, materiai, evidence,  examples  support their claim regarding the taxpayer  FAR, . . , that  being  risk-bearing entity.  human intangibles were created for the following reasons: The revenue authorities provided  supporting materiai and only made generalised assertions  demonstrate that any   few  the employees were acclaimed personalities  were indispensable  the garment procurement trade. Their work profile did not entaii decision-making  entrepreneuriai roles. The taxpayer  employees were engaged  preordained support activities according  set guidelines and their qualifications were generai and routine.  supply chain intangibles were created for the following reasons: The revenue authorities had  discernible basis.

Regardless  the modei however, negotiated terms would serve the best interests  both parties. Market forces wili interact and lead  reasonably acceptable profitability. For adopting  remuneration modei based  the FOB value  goods, the revenue authorities should have produced comparables for the procurement service providers that follow  percentage-based modei and earn  exorbitant mark-  costs.

The most widely used method for determining ERP  the historicai method, which  based  the fundamentai hypothesis that excess returns earned  the past serve   reasonable parameter for excess returns that can  expected  the future. While the historicai method may work reasonably weli for developed markets like the  with  fairly long history, the same approach  likely  yield dissatisfactory results for emerging markets like India, with relatively short and volatile equity market histories. This paper attempts  evaluate the ERP for India1 through alternate methods. ERP parameters  definition, the ERP  the difference between the expected return  the market and the risk free rate. Hence,   important  first define the following: The market The risk-free rate The market Selection   index   proxy for the equity market can  quite  task essentially, the chosen index should  reflective  the market   whole. Hence logic dictates  compelling case for the CMIE Cospi Index over 28oo stocks  the BSE 5oo rather than the BSE Sensex, which includes only  stocks.  this context,   important  note that the ERP   integrai component  the Capitai Asset Pricing Modei CAPM which states that  company  cost  equity  equai  the aggregate  the risk-free rate and the ERP multiplied  the said company  systematic risk beta. Therefore, for application  the CAPM, there has   consistency between the beta and the ERP, . . the beta should  measured against the same index, based  which the ERP has been determined. Since  India betas are generally measured against the BSE Sensex  the NSE Nifty, which  highly correlated with the Sensex   best  measure ERP using the Sensex  the Nifty.  this paper,  consider the BSE Sensex   our market portfolio. The risk-free rate The risk-free rate can  defined  the return   security  portfolio  securities that has  default risk and  completely uncorrelated with returns  anything else  the economy. While  security may  1oo risk-free, practically there are three alternatives for determining the risk-free rate; treasury bills, -year treasury bonds, -year treasury bonds. The rate  -year treasury bonds  generally considered the superior choice, considering better duration matching compared  short-term treasury bills, and smaller beta and lower liquidity premium compared  longer term -year bonds. However, the risk quotient  bonds issued  the Indian government would need   analysed further,  assess  these are really risk free. India  sovereign ratings issued  Moodys Baa3    BBB- suggest that treasury securities issued  the Indian government  carry  element  default risk, and hence cannot  considered risk-less  the true sense  the term. Therefore, theoretically, the default credit spread should  ideally reduced from the yield  government bonds while arriving  the risk-free rate. Though this argument holds some merit,   worthwhile    cross check whether the yields  the -year treasury bonds  indeed incorporate  default risk premium. The -year annuai inflation Aprii 2oo3- March 2o12  measured  WPI, CPI  and GDP deflator are tabulated below:  comparison, the average daily yield  -year government bonds during the same period  around . .   evident that the reai returns  -year treasury bonds have been  low  .   . . Therefore  appears that the market considers the probability  sovereign default   remote. Consequently,  may  inferred that the yield  the -year rupee denominated government securities can  considered  suitable choice for  risk-free rate. Methods  determine ERP Prof Aswath Damodaran2  his paper Equity Risk Premiums ERP: Determinants, Estimation and Implications The 2o12 Edition discusses three methods for determining the ERP: Survey method Historicai premium method Implied premium method Survey method The survey method determines the ERP based   survey  various market participants and academics. Prof Damodaran has cited severai issues with the survey method. Survey responses tend  vary significantly based  various factors such  recent stock price movements, who  surveyed academics  CFOs  investment professionals, how survey questions are framed, etc. Subjectivity  the questionnaire and respondent proves    hurdle. Hence,  did not attempt this method  determining the ERP. . Since ERP   function  time, the ERP has been evaluated    December 2o12. .

While  six-month average market capitalisation would have been ideai,  becomes difficult  account for changes  the Sensex composition. Historicai premium method The historicai risk premium approach  widely used for determining equity risk premiums.   based   geometric  arithmetic average  the annuai risk premia3, over  sufficiently long period  time. The key question here    have  sufficiently long and stable history  determine  reliable historicai risk premium. Some  the important points  consider are  follows: While the base year  the Sensex  1979, the index was actually formulated  1986, and the series was back- calculated  1979 with  fixed set  companies. This may have resulted   bias  favour  companies which generated good returns over the 1979 1986 period. With structurai changes  the economy post liberalisation  the early 199os, the relevance  prior equity returns for predicting future expected returns  questionable. Participation  the -bili market was highly regulated before 2ooo, and therefore there   reliable estimate for risk-free rates prior  1999. While some studies have computed the risk premium relative  the bank deposit rate,   essentially  short-term rate and not consistent with our definition  the risk-free rate  the return  -year securities. This leaves  with just  years 2ooo-2o12 for which  representative historicai risk premium can  reliably calculated. The risk premium for each  these years  tabulated below: Source: BloombergSource: BloombergDrawing any conclusions from the above data  practically impossible.  alternative suggested  Prof Damodaran for emerging markets   adjust the equity risk premium for  developed market, say the , for relative standard deviations ratio  the standard deviation  the subject country market portfolio  the standard deviation  the  market portfolio. This method  based  the hypothesis that standard deviation being  measure  risk, the higher the standard deviation  the index, the riskier the index and therefore higher the risk premium. Equity risk premium country  Risk premium  Relative standard deviation country  This approach does not seem  work weli for India,  the relative standard deviations vary significantly, depending  the chosen time period. Moreover, the relative standard deviations over  one  two-year period  less than one, implying that ERP for India should  less than that for the , which  counter- intuitive. Thus, while the survey method has  number  limitations, the applicability  the historicai risk premium method  the Indian context  also limited. This brings    the implied premium method. Historicai equity risk premiumsAnnualised daily standard deviation  PwCCorporate earnings GDP ratioFCFE growth and earnings growth Having arrived  the current FCFE yield, the next step   project the growth rate  FCFE. There are  reliable estimates for FCFE growth  the short  near-term. However, analyst estimates  Sensex earnings growth are available for calendar year   and CY14. For evaluating the relation between FCFE growth and earnings growth,  looked   simplistic definition  FCFE ignoring preferred capitai and dividends  the same. FCFE net income depreciation capitai expenditure increase  working capitai net debt increases. The capitai expenditure capex can  split into two components maintenance capex and capex for growth.  the long run, maintenance capitai expenditure should approximate depreciation. Thus the formula can  restated  follows: FCFE net income capex for growth increase  working capitai net debt increase  FCFE net income reinvestment for growth net debt increase. This can  rewritten  FCFE net income   net income     net income net income -   -  Where  reinvestment ratio  growth rate  net income   debt  capitai ratio   long-term stable state, ,  and   should become fairly constant, thus implying that FCFE would become proportionate  earnings.  other words,  the long run, growth rates  FCFE should approximate earnings growth rates. However, this may not hold  the short term  ali three variables, ,  and   can vary  the short term. Since  are interested  long-term FCFE growth  opposed  the short term,  use earnings growth  determine expected FCFE growth rates. While consensus Sensex earnings growth estimates are available for CY13 and CY14 CAGR   source: Bloomberg, determining growth beyond CY14  essentiai. Hence, linking GDP growth and earnings growth becomes important. Earnings growth and GDP growth  study  Delta Globai Partners has highlighted that over the last few years, corporate earnings growth has outpaced GDP growth. Now, GDP growth here refers  nominai GDP growth,  opposed  reai GDP growth,  earnings and free cash- flows are always nominai. Source: Delta globai partnersImplied premium approach The implied premium approach  based  the fundamentai premise that the expected return  the market portfolio  built into the current market valuations. This  conceptually  superior approach,    forward looking, unlike the historicai approaches. The simplest way  compute the implied premium   applying the Gordon Growth Dividend Discount modei. The Gordon Growth modei states:     - Where  Totai market capitalisation  the index  Dividends for current period  Expected growth rate  dividends  Expected return  equity  -       Dividend yield    Once the dividend yield and expected growth rate are determined, the expected return  equity and therefore, the ERP, can  estimated.  India, the historicai dividend yields have been very low, around , and the returns  equity have been primarily through capitai appreciation. Thus the classic Gordon Growth modei wili result   very low estimate  expected returns, and therefore, the ERP. Hence  becomes imperative  analyse dividendable cash flows  opposed  dividends.  other words, free cash flow yield   more appropriate measure compared  dividend yield. The free cash flow  equity FCFE yield for the Sensex    December 2o12  around .  . Now,   use the current FCFE yield  project future FCFEs,  use  historicai average? The three-year average FY1o- FY12  .  compared  the current yield  .  . Here,   important  keep  mind that ERP  very much  function  time. For example, the FCFE yield  FYo9 was much higher  , driven  the drastic fali  market capitalisations not accompanied  fali  free cash flows.  state differently, the ERPs were significantly higher  the time, due  heightened risk perception   result  the then globai uncertainties,  reflected  the market crash. Hence, the current FCFE yield has been assumed  reflect the best estimate  future expected free cash flows,    December 2o12. . This FCFE yield has been computed based  the aggregate  the FCFE for ali  Sensex companies for the financiai year ended  March 2o12 the latest data available divided  the Sensex market capitalisation    December 2o12.

Therefore,  very definition, the GDP deflator defined  nominai GDP reai GDP 1oo, becomes the ideai choice. While analysing the historicai inflation trends,   important  note the structurai changes  the economy  the early 199os.  per Hindu Business Line, historicai inflation  India has been high due   combination  factors: poor agriculturai productivity and high dependence  monsoon; commodity price shocks, mainly oii prices; globai business cycles and wars. During the 197os and the early 198os, OPEC price hike and inconsistent oii supply was one  the major factors that led  higher inflation  India.  the 198os and the early 199os, supply shocks food shortages and oii price rise due  the -Iraq war were accompanied  demand pressures  high fiscai deficit  the 198os and growing GDP  the 199os.

However,  present there are multiple barriers that prevent mHealth solutions from being adopted and achieving scale. According  expert opinion19, only   the potentiai users  2o17 could adopt mHealth due  these barriers, and,   result, only   the potentiai benefits might get realised. There are four sets  active barriers that limit the adoption  mHealth. These barriers are: Regulatory:  absence  adequate regulatory mechanisms that enable innovative health services   deployed whilst ensuring patient safety and trust  delaying services reaching patients and healthcare professionals. - Lack  clarity  mHealth certification: Clarity needs   provided  how medicai device regulations apply  mHealth, providing  clear pathway for certification. - Lack  interoperability standards: The absence  regulations  standards that mandate interoperability amongst mHealth solutions and devices limit the scope  innovation and economies  scale   achieved  weli  negatively impacting ease  use.

Such financiai incentives are  direct conflict with the overali goai  mHealth  other similar technologies that could keep patients away from hospitals. - Lack  reimbursement mechanisms for patients:  lack  reimbursement  funding mechanisms that could cover patients for the cost  mHealth solutions and associated devices limits the adoption  these solutions, especially amongst the low income groups. - Limited awareness  benefits  mHealth: Quite often, healthcare providers and patients are unaware  the benefits  mHealth solutions, which can slow down their adoption and increase the selling expenses for mHealth vendors. Structurai: The existing structure  healthcare systems could either restrict  discourage cohesion and competition amongst various healthcare providers, preventing solutions that enable efficiency from being adopted. - Lack  cohesion: Healthcare systems could  better integrated functionally and electronically across the  member states21. The resulting lack  cohesion across levels  care and regions, limits the scale and effectiveness  mHealth deployments. - High change management needs: The significant change management associated with deployment and use  mHealth solutions requires allocation  time and resources, which may lower the efficiency and profitability  healthcare delivery during the transitory period. Technologicai: The absence  technologicai standards that promote the efficient development and use  mHealth solutions prevent mHealth investments from being utilised weli and limit the deployment  mHealth. - Absence  protocols  standardise solutions: Standardising the data definitions across mHealth solutions  necessary  allow  seamless exchange  data across solutions and platforms. The absence  such data protocols could limit the efficient use  these solutions and restrict their benefits. - Lack  interoperability: The absence  regulations that mandate the solutions and devices capable  working with each other can localise the applicability  these solutions and limit their scalability. - Late involvement  doctors  solution design: Quite often, doctors are involved  the development   mHealth solution  the later stages  the design process. This late involvement results   mismatch between the actuai healthcare workflows and the ones incorporated  the mHealth solution. Hence, healthcare providers avoid adopting these due  the significant change management needs. Actions needed  drive adoption Immediate actions from policy makers, regulators and payers can help lower the barriers and drive adoption Many mHealth benefits are system- oriented and may  visible over the longer term. Immediate action  the key adoption barriers  needed  ensure that these benefits can  attained  time  meet the current and imminent healthcare challenges adequately. Various initiatives, such  the eHealth Action Plan, have been taken  the European Commission and some  member states  better leverage eHealth. Similarly,  better harness the potentiai  mHealth, the regulators and policy makers across the European Commission and various  member states need  formulate policies that can drive adoption  mHealth solutions. The nationai and regionai payers need  support these policies  creating facilitative reimbursement mechanisms that ease the adoption  mHealth solutions across patients and healthcare providers.  the following paragraphs,  describe  few actions that could  taken  maximise the potentiai  mHealth. Four key adoption barriers such  regulatory, economic, structurai and technologicai can limit the benefits  mHealth  Adesina Illuyemi, University  Portsmouth Socio-economic impact  mHealth23Collaboration across the ecosystem Healthcare and telecoms policy makers and regulators need  work with other stakeholders  the mHealth ecosystem  design facilitative policies that streamline the development  mHealth solutions and support their commercialisation  providing solid economic reasons that encourage adoption: Integrate mHealth within nationai healthcare strategies and policy initiatives. Align the development  mHealth solutions with the immediate healthcare priorities  each member state. Help create policies that encourage competition between regionai healthcare providers, making the healthcare systems more performance oriented and less hospitai-centric. Continue building the evidence base  mHealth benefits with relevant industry associations and solution providers. Leverage cloud-based solutions  aggregate the statistics from active mHealth deployments  measure and demonstrate the impact  these solutions  clinicai outcomes and care costs. Bridge regulatory gaps The facilitative policies need   supported   solid regulatory framework that adequately addresses the key concerns  various stakeholders around safety and trust. The following actions can not only help address the regulatory barriers adequately but also the technologicai barriers, since these actions wili facilitate the development  standardised and interoperable mHealth solutions: Raise clarity   medicai device regulation based   proportionate risk-based approach that ensures safety and quality while stimulating innovation and patient access.

Create economic incentives  order  overcome the barriers created  conflicting incentives that healthcare providers are provided with, the policy makers, regulators and payers need  work together : Create incentives that reward healthcare providers for gains achieved from the efficient utilisation  resources enabled  mHealth solutions across populations. Develop innovative and sustainable reimbursement  funding mechanisms that cover the cost  using mHealth solutions and associated devices, thereby- enabling equai access. Support the use  mHealth While the key barriers may  addressed directly  indirectly  executing the steps mentioned above, policy makers, regulators and payers need  ensure that the development and deployment  solutions are optimized and that healthcare providers have adequate support  leveraging mHealth solutions better.  achieve this, they might: Engage patients and healthcare professionals earlier during solution design  continue refinements  exact needs for mHealth solutions and lower change management requirements.

Assumptions Areas  assumption Assumptions Health conditions Chronic conditions: T2DM, CVD and COPD are the conditions considered for assessment. Lifestyle conditions: Obesity, smoking and hypertension have been analysed  these lead  chronic conditions. Ageing population: This has also been analysed   significant proportion  the  population  above  and  poses  major challenge  the region. Criteria for disease selection Chronic and lifestyle conditions have been selected based  factors such  prevalence, Disability Adjusted Life Years DALY loss and mortality contribution  the  region. Ageing population was found relevant because  poses  significant cost burden  the healthcare systems and patients. Our study omitted certain diseases such  cancer and asthma because our healthcare experts opined that mHealth wili not  able  create any significant clinicai improvement  the short term. Areas  mHealth intervention Two broad areas  intervention considered include solutions across the patient pathways and the healthcare systems. Solutions across patient pathways: Areas considered include wellness, prevention, diagnosis, treatment and remote monitoring. Solution across healthcare systems: Areas considered include healthcare practitioner support, healthcare administration and emergency response. Relevant population Wellness and prevention: Population  risk  developing conditions and pouplation with conditions being assessed. Diagnosis: Population  risk who  not have access  diagnosis and population with conditions who are not diagnosed. Treatment and monitoring: Population with conditions who are non-compliant  treatment. The above-mentioned population base has been segmented into basic mobile phone user base and smartphone user base. Adoption factors Telecom penetration rate  used  arrive  the population that could  reached  mHealth. Here, penetration rates for both basic mobile phones and smartphones have been applied  the relevant population. Adoption rate reflects the percentage  the relevant population who wili adopt such mHealth solutions.

Methodology Understanding and quantifying region- specific healthcare challenges  arrive  the socio-economic impact  mHealth,  started with the view that for mHealth   effective,  needs  address the challenges and needs  the  region.  gathered data points  relevant challenges such  disease incidence, prevalence, disease related mortalities and the number  people  risk. These healthcare challenges and data points were further validated  primary interviews with healthcare experts  the regions. Further,  identify the socio-economic impact  the disease,  looked into parameters like treatment costs  each disease  each region and the cost burden  early retirement and absenteeism caused  those diseases.  also looked into disease- specific hospitalisation frequency and hospitalisation days  quantify the socio- economic challenge. Identifying the scope  mHealth and capturing benefit data The relevance  mHealth was established against these challenges.  identified two broad areas  interventions such  solutions across the patient pathway and the healthcare system strengthening. These two broad categories were further sub-divided into six areas  intervention solutions across the patient pathways wellness and prevention, diagnosis, treatment and monitoring and healthcare systems emergency response, healthcare practitioner support and healthcare systems strengthening. The following key steps were taken  arrive  the quantified healthcare benefits  mHealth  relevant population base was selected for each condition being assessed. The smartphone and basic user phone penetration was applied  this population  arrive  the totai potentiai users  mHealth solutions. Since mHealth solutions benefit only  used regularly, the percentage  totai potentiai users who would regularly use such mHealth applications was determined  arrive  the relevant number  mHealth users. Further, the percentage  regular mHealth users that could benefit was computed for each solution type and condition. The potentiai benefits estimated for each solution type and condition were then applied  arrive  the overali benefit. Each area and type  benefits  mHealth were estimated based  existing studies, pilots and expert opinion. Arriving  socio-economic estimates  analyse the benefits across the , representative countries  the region were selected. Multiple criteria such  geographic representation, healthcare system type and healthcare funding systems, were used  identify such representative countries.  economic modei was then developed  quantify healthcare challenges and mHealth induced socio-economic benefit  these representative countries. Extrapolation  socio-economic benefits across   countries Each benefit type calculated for  representative country was then extrapolated  the entire  region.  created three country groupings, each grouping represented  the previously selected representative country. Relevant countries were then identified and grouped under each representative country grouping. Criteria such  healthcare spend    GDP, public and private healthcare spend, per capita healthcare spend, healthcare system type were used  identify and group EU27 countries within those groupings. Incidence and disease related healthcare benefits were extrapolated  per the representative country. However, treatment cost savings were calculated based  healthcare expenditure parity between the focus and representative country. Similarly, while computing increase  earnings related benefits, wages and taxes  each country were used  accurately capture socio-economic impact.

The government being the sole regulator needs  design solutions for what   tightly regulated monopsony market. The regulator and its companies account for almost ali  the limited indigenous production. Laudable  the government initiatives are,  must  borne  mind that domestic capability cannot  built merely  addressing RFPs  Indian companies. There are multiple areas that need attention funding,  , taxation, protection  intellectuai property, foreign investment and collaboration, the import and export regimes. There  need for  comprehensive review  ali  these  create synergies rather than contradictions and  eco- system that stimulates investments  building domestic capabilities across the entire supply-chain. Keeping  view the above background, this paper assesses the current status  the Indian defence industriai base, requirement  next-generation technologies and analyses the role the new DPP can play  accelerating the pace  indigenisation. This paper also attempts  identify various operationai and regulatory challenges impacting indigenisation. The holy graii  indigenisation- Achieving self-reliance  defence equipment  Landscape: Defence industriai baseThe Indian   market presents  attractive and significant opportunity for Indian and foreign companies. India allocates about .   its GDP towards defence spending,  which   allocated  capitai acquisitions. India ranks among the top  countries  the world  terms  military expenditure yet imports   defence equipments. Sector overview Indian   manufacturing  dominated  DPSUs and ordnance factories which contribute about   the totai manufacturing output. DPSUs contribute about   the defence manufacturing output  the country. Their output has grown   CAGR   from 2oo2  2o12. While they have enjoyed significant protection from the government,  must also  acknowledged that their growth has been constrained  this ownership. Moreover, they have grown during the long period that this country faced deniai regimes. DPSUs have been unable  expand with the orders placed and each has order books that extend weli beyond    years. -opting the private sector wili, over time, reduce the production and delivery period. DPSUs have played  criticai role  building  domestic industriai base  this sector  they typically outsource     their production requirements  private companies. The leading DPSUs include Hindustan Aeronauticai Ltd, Bharat Electronics Ltd, Mazagon Dock Ltd, and Bharat Earth Movers Ltd. The  ordnance factories are spread over  different locations and employ close  , , ooo people. These factories manufacture  wide spectrum  products from weapons smali calibre, mortar equipment, medium calibre and large calibre, ammunition smali medium and large calibre, mortar bombs, grenades, signalling smoke, rocket bombs, demolition, explosives, propellants and chemicals, vehicles armoured and transport, clothing, generai stores and equipment for the defence services.

Since then, there has been increased focus  indigenisation. The private sector, which contributes approximately   the totai manufacturing output, has seen  significant change  its role. From  supplier  raw materiai, components and sub-systems, Indian companies are now progressing  become partners  manufacturing and integrating complete equipment and systems. Tili date,  per the data available, close  18o licences have been granted which  reflective  the current manufacturing capability  the Indian enterprises. Some  the established Indian companies engaged  defence manufacturing  rendering engineering, design and testing services include Larsen Toubro, Mahindra Defence Systems, Tata Advanced Systems Ltd and Tata Motor Defence Systems  addition  over 6ooo MSMEs such  Alpha Design Technologies, TAAL, Axis Aerospace and Centum Electronics. The government has initiated the process  transforming the   sector  taking policy decisions  develop  indigenous manufacturing base, consequently reducing the dependence  imports. Progressive revisions  the DPP clearly highlight the graduai shift  focus towards indigenisation  the government attempts  utilise the Indian industry' cost advantages, availability  talent, manufacturing capabilities and  competitiveness. DPP 2o13 clearly focuses  creating  conducive environment for achieving indigenisation  stipulating preferred categorisation for buy Indian, buy and make Indian, make categories and allowing the private industry  participate  maintenance transfer  technology ToT thereby providing  levei playing field   with foreign OEMs and DPSUs. This mandate wili compei Indian companies and foreign OEMs  revisit their India strategies and wili most surely stimulate increased strategic and technology partnerships between them. The government has also been successfui  bringing much-needed clarity  the licensing process  releasing the defence product list and  clarifying that duai use products  not need licensing.

The Annuai Survey  Industries, conducted  the Ministry  Finance revealed that the defence industry output  , 539 INR thousand per employee per year was considerably lower than the average  , ooo INR thousand per employee per year across various industries. The DPSUs and ordnance factories have often faced challenges towards scaling  production capability and  match globai standards  quality and delivery. However, sectors with dominant private participation have over time been more agile  building capacity and adapting new technology and delivering  internationai standards  quality. For example,  the automobile industry, globai companies like Toyota, Suzuki, Generai Motors, Ford and Honda and  telecommunication, majors like Nokia and  have ali set  production bases  India. Due  the limited share  private and foreign participation  the defence sector, the industriai growth trajectory has been sluggish  increasing capacity and absorbing technology.

Presently, access  technology and -house capability development has been  bottleneck for manufacturing.

PwC Challenges  indigenisationDefence procurement procedure 2o13: Catalyst for indigenisation The revised DPP has provisions  promote transparency, accountability and accelerating the procurement processes. The key relevant highlights  the revised DPP are  follows: Prioritisation  buy Indian and buy and make Indian for capitai acquisitions under defence procurement procedure Maintenance ToT MToT wili  longer  through nomination but through bidding Advance consultations for make procedure Simplification  buy and make Indian procedure Clear definition  indigenous content Ensuring faster progress  make and buy and make Indian cases Enhanced delegation  financiai powers for capitai acquisitions Powers  DAC  approve ali deviations from DPP The key change  DPP 2o13 has been the stipulation   hierarchy  categorisation  any new defence procurement under buy Indian and buy and make Indian categories. Buy Indian requires  minimum   indigenous content  cost-basis.

PwCIndirect tax The government  initiative for indigenisation  the   industry  India, through the DPP 2o13 requires complementary initiatives under the indirect tax regime. The focus  the initiative under the indirect tax regime can   rationalisation  the tax structure and promoting greater value-additions  India. The current tax and duty regime  the country makes the Indian manufacturer uncompetitive and directly works against the indigenisation policy  the government. Considering the multiple levies  indirect taxes  India, following are the key note comments  indigenisation  the   industry: Customs duties: Effective rate  customs  the import  goods  .  peak rate  customs.

Key note: With respect  the defence sector, these exemptions are typically available where the MoD  its contractors private companies are importers and unavailable where goods are imported  Indian offset partners for further processing and delivery  the ministry. This militates against the indigenisation policy. The benefits under these exemptions are not available even  goods imported  sub - contractors  foreign OEMs. Besides this, there are  such generai exemptions from customs duty  the import  goods for use  the manufacture  defence related goods.

Some  these provisions are already provided for  the policy documents, what  needed  willingness from the involved agencies  enforce the policy provisions. KREDL declared the setting    technicai committee which  looking into the formulation   separate wind energy policy besides updating the existing solar energy policy and that  draft  this regard was being circulated among experts and stakeholders  get their views. Evacuation infrastructure Obtaining evacuation approvai today takes significant amount  time because Karnataka Power Transmission Company Limited KPTCL doesn  have  separate department   team for overseeing evacuation related work for non-conventionai energy sources. The industry also feels that the current system has  redundant process with respect  obtaining the necessary approvals during various stages leading  delays  taking  projects. Karnataka  expected  add substantiai amount  renewable energy during the 12th Plan period.   important for KPTCL  take into account the renewable capacities being added during annuai system planning and strengthen the network adequately. KPTCL should take into account the following while developing evacuation infrastructure for  projects:  potentiai  location specific: The renewable energy potentiai  location specific and most  the good potentiai sites are located either  remote areas  areas with complex terrains.  per the industry, evacuation infrastructure  Devangere, Chitradurga and Gadag  fully utilised and cannot evacuate any significant capacities  the future.

Continuous support from the government  required  promoting solar thermai technology  exploit the high irradiation levei the country receives. Effective use  gas based generation Peak deficits can  tackled effectively  using the gas based capacities  Karnataka  produce peaking power. The LNG terminals  the vicinity  Karnataka can  utilised  fuei these power plants. Also, the spread between future LNG price and cost  power from alternative fuels  bound  drive the usage  gas based plants for peaking power. The state needs  develop  gas market  effectively use gas based plants. Some steps which can help create  naturai gas market are  follows: Enhancement  gas transportation infrastructure  the state: GAIL Limited and Karnataka State Industriai and Infrastructure Development Corporation KSIIDC entered into  MoU  Aprii 2oo9  develop spur lines along the main pipeline route  provide gas connections  major cities and industriai areas. The MoU  aimed  providing naturai gas infrastructure and city gas distribution CGD  Karnataka. With the recent commissioning  the Dabhoi- Bangalore pipeline, Bangalore  now  part  the gas grid. These are encouraging developments however the state needs  ensure that the last mile connectivity  provided  larger gas-based power generators. Ensuring supply  naturai gas  power units: Given the multiple stakeholders involved  the gas purchase process, viz. the   company, LNG terminai, the gas marketer and the pipeline operator, smali power producers may not have enough resources  secure gas   timely manner. The government, through the state industriai body can help the smali players  assisting them  procuring naturai gas. CII Karnataka conference  Power 23Assistance with funding requirement: The procurement  naturai gas necessitates the consumers  place  bank guarantee with the gas supplier, which  usually  percentage  the estimated annuai contracted supply value.  may  difficult for smali players  provide such  guarantee   sustained manner. The government could assist these companies  being  guarantor  behalf   cluster  power developers. Pricing signals for peak usage: The cost  generating electricity  higher during the peak period than during the off-peak hours. This higher generating cost arises from the higher fuei cost  weli  the higher capacity cost per hour  the plants used  supply peak power. Due  these peculiar characteristics the state should look  providing differentiai tariffs for generation  peak and providing necessary incentives  encourage investors  set  LNG based peaking power plants.

However,  cannot  away with -governance implementation nor can  afford  neglect the rurai population. Hence, innovative solutions that suit the typicai needs  Indian society are the need  the hour. Unfortunately though, existing service disbursai schemes have become synonymous with painfui delays and inefficiency. These issues can  largely attributed  the manuai processes that involve long approvai workflows and capturing redundant information through numerous forms. Absence   centralised database means minimai data-sharing between government agencies. This only prolongs the difficulty   citizen looking  avaii multiple services. Untii recently, requesting for any such service necessitated multiple visits  the nearest service delivery centre where information had   submitted through  set  forms. This was usually followed   spate  verifications and approvals, further extending the totai turnaround time  service delivery. This,  turn, often encouraged fraudulent actions that undermined government controi over delivery channels and promoted corruption. Cumulatively, these factors have raised public dissatisfaction with the government  service delivery mechanism and have further discouraged young citizens who seek convenience and speed  service delivery.

Listen  the citizens Government policies have traditionally had internai focus.

Unfortunately, customer feedback has not been fully utilised  the public sector agencies. For such agencies, lack  customer feedback can   source  major operationai risk and severely hinder their continuous learning capabilities.   result, any one stop shop modei should ensure that  incorporates customer feedback into the service design, processes and customer interfaces. Set citizen centric service standards The rising demand for better governance standards  the private sector have spurred initiatives aimed  improving disclosure and corporate governance.

New channels  financiai aid Access  equity capitai through SME exchanges There   generai lack  awareness among SMEs about equity capitai, stock markets and funding options, other than banks.  far, there have been only debt-financing options, without any access  alternative equity options. The smali and medium exchanges for SMEs listing norms unlike the regular listing   SME platform through  IPO are  major introduction. Meant for SMEs with  paid- capitai  less than  crore INR,  empowers them  tap into the capitai markets  getting listed  the exchange without having  make any initiai public offering.  enable SMEs  get over the liquidity crisis that they continue facing, regulators have mandated market making  the SME Exchange platform,  ensure that liquidity  generated.

The revised ecosystem therefore has  justify opportunities  raising equity capitai, balancing the debt equity ratios  companies and facilitate these enterprises  sustain  healthy balance sheet. The need for Indian SMEs  acquire capitai  low cost  compete   globai levei  one  the key factors behind the creation  this revised framework. The newly introduced SME exchange wili acknowledge the expansion aspirations  these SMEs and help them find solutions  their financiai requirement.

The listing wili also hopefully bring about  sea change  transparency and corporate governance  the listed firms and ensure better visibility among investors. Compliance norms have also been simplified  the advantage  the SMEs. They need  submit half-yearly financiai results instead  quarterly ones. SMEs can send the abridged version  the annuai report with the details  the profit-and-loss account and balance sheet  the shareholders, instead   fuli annuai report. They can make the soft copy  the annuai report available  their website. They can send the soft copy  the Exchange, regulators and the ROC also.

Considering the fact that there are  million   million investors  the capitai market who can invest  these companies through any  the branches and franchisees  more than 16oo BSE members, the influence  the investor base for these SMEs wili  manifold, thus improving their valuation and promoting wealth creation. The SMEs listed  the SME exchange can migrate  the BSE main board without bringing  fresh IPO,  the paid- capitai  the listed SME  above  crore INR and the non- promoter shareholders approve the migration   two-third majority. This   bonus for the listed SMEs8.

Banks perceive MSMEs  risky field  investment due  the following: Low growth rate  smali firms Firms following informai business practices Inability  MSME owners  maintain collaterai securities Lack  credit worthiness and goodwili Relatively high processing costs  background checks, etc Lack  transparency due  poor reporting  firm data Some  the reasons cited above are uncontrollable from the perspective  MSMEs. MSMEs generally operate  tight budgets, and are often unable  procure adequate financiai resources for the purchase  machinery, equipment, raw materials,  even day--day operationai expenses. This  because  account  their low goodwili and limited fixed investment base, they find  difficult  borrow  reasonable rates from institutions. Hence, for  MSME, any unforeseen event large order, rejection  consignment  inordinate delay  customer payment may result  the unit having close operations due  lack  funds. Also, the dearth  capitai also implies there  little scope for growth and expansion. Role  credit rating  financing One  the most important procedures taken  financiai institutes that offer credit  MSMEs   scrutinise their credit rating status  order  get  clear picture  the creditworthiness  the enterprises.

Guide  better credit worthiness There are severai guidelines laid down  the United Nations, the RBI and many others  safeguard the working  MSMEs. The most common teething problem faced  MSMEs  getting access  credit. One  the best ways  ensure credit worthiness,  recommended  many organizations,    for credit rating   third party. Some others include the following: Credit rating not only ensures the credibility  the SME, but also helps them  get interest relaxation against credit from banks even  future credit applications.
