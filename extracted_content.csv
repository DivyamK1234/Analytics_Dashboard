Continuing with the momentum initiated in July 2024, the current set of proposals aims to streamline business 
operations and enhance predictability. It's refreshing to see the government addressing the challenges of the middle class amidst the economic slowdown. This budget is strategically designed to stimulate spending and drive economic growth, as reflected in the revised individual tax rates.
For professionals in the fund industry, reduced complexity and certainty are extremely important. Simplified tax rules, 
such as clearer guidelines on capital gains and the removal of the 0.1% securities purchase tax, mark a step in the

Foreword 
Energy security forms the basis of formulating energy policy in every 
country. For a developing nation like India, energy security, assumes critical importance, since the projected requirements have to be met in an environment where domestic energy supplies are limited and the energy needs are to be met through imports, amidst the persisting international uncertainties.
In the pursuit of sustainable development, securing adequate energy 
supply that is affordable and easily accessible, is a major concern both financially and strategically. To address these challenges, we need to enhance the domestic growth drivers, remove structural constraints and above all, make ourselves resilient to external factors like, volatile international crude oil prices, economic and geopolitical un..."

The construction industry  p4/Building and  home products p6


The services sector has, over the last few years, accounted for over 60% of India’s GDP, and 
underpinned a significant share of employment creation and growth. Within this, construction has been important, not just for its direct contribution to GDP, but also because it drives demand for a range of manufactured products, from cement to sanitary-ware. Initiatives from the government to support and stimulate this sector would, therefore, have a positive impact on the economy as a whole, and the manufacturing sector in particular.
Urbanisation has been a growing phenomenon that now extends beyond the metros. The emergence 
of ‘Census Towns’ and the noticeable ‘rurban’ sprawl indicating the shift to the tertiary sector as employment patterns shift, is indicative of changing lifestyles and consumption patterns. Rising income and improvement in s..."

lowest rate in a decade, Indian CEOs 
continue to be optimistic about their 
growth prospects. However, they have

Effective technology, which can drive innovation so as to help enterprises meet 
the current challenges of the disruptive business environment, cannot exist in vacuum. Within his or her changing role, a CIO also has to collaborate with the 
other members of the C-suite, in order to understand and analyse the risks and 
opportunities while developing a technology roadmap.
The convergence of four technologies, namely social media, mobility, analytics 
and big data, and cloud computing (SMAC), can potentially address the CIO’s 
current needs. Though each of these technologies has a unique impact, they 
complement each other to foster innovation and enable business transformation through new ways of product development, customer service and interaction, and partnerships..."

tarnished the image of banks and eroded the foundation on which these institutions were 
built- public trust. 
And yet, the banking system not only survives, it manages to pull itself together to fulfil the 
enhanced expectations from ever more vigilant and demanding stakeholders. Some of the 
largest banks in the world learn lessons in humility as capital and compliance standards seem 
constantly inadequate to stand up to the aggressive benchmarks set by regulators to restore 
confidence in their banks, and possibly themselves.

The Indian pharma market is currently valued at 72069 crore INR1. The

down to 9.8% from 16.6% in 20122. This slowdown can be attributed to 
the new drug pricing policy and the regulatory interventions over the last year. 
The Indian pharmaceutical industry is witnessing regulatory challenges 
like delays in clinical trial approvals, uncertainties over the FDI policy, the new pharmaceutical pricing policy, a uniform code for sales and marketing practices and compulsory licensing.

Last year, without a doubt, was challenging for the private equity (PE) business in India. 
Though the year, specifically the first couple of months, witnessed PE firms make a bunch of 
successful exits, the mood turned sombre when the government, as a part of the budget proposals, announced some draconian tax legislation which left majority of the PE community in a quandary. 
PE funds were not even thinking about further investments, but more worried about the impact the 
proposed legislation will have on their existing investments and business models. 
Owing to the high valuations at which the investments were made in 2007 and 2008, a number of 
portfolio investments of PE funds are currently not ‘in the money’ and with the falling Indian rupee  
(down 23%), exits were becoming even less attractive. In this scenario, the intended change in tax

The Micro Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) sector in India is essential to 
achieving the targeted growth rate of our nation. This sector nurtures budding 
entrepreneurs and incubates innovation at its most rudimentary level. A growth

demonstrated an average growth of 12%, raising the share of the manufacturing

organisations to take a ‘do more with less’ approach. Leading companies are starting 
to realise that cloud computing is far more than a better IT solution–it is in fact a 
better business solution. Cloud computing has the potential to accelerate business 
innovation and address the challenges facing today’s CIO. 
Business leaders are exploring new business models around cloud to increase 
productivity, create operational efficiencies, redefine ways of customer engagement 
and fuel innovation. Cloud has the potential to transform IT departments through 
infrastructure consolidation and optimisation, reduced costs and increased scalability. 
The business agility attributed by cloud computing is creating competitive advantage 
for companies in these unprecedented times of radical economic changes and market 
dynamics. No wonder cloud is ..."

September 2013
The Finance Act, 2012 ushered in a number of transfer pricing amendments, most significant among them being 
the extension of transfer pricing provisions to specified domestic transactions (SDTs).  
Prior to this, transfer pricing provisions were applicable only to crossborder transactions (ITP).
The genesis of the above amendment lies in the Supreme Court case of Glaxo Smithkline1 wherein the apex court 
stated the need to extend existing transfer pricing provisions to domestic transactions.Consequent to the above amendment, the following transactions are covered within the ambit of domestic 
transfer pricing (DTP) regulations:
• Expenditure under section 40A(2)
• Transfer of goods and services between the tax holiday undertaking and other undertakings of the taxpayer
• Business transacted between the tax holiday undertaking and other ‘closely connected entities’
• Any other notified transactionForeword

A robust and thriving development sector is central to India’s quest for equitable, inclusive

decades and is now witnessing unprecedented interest and investments across the value chain.
With the passage of the Companies Act, 2013 the mandate for corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) has been formally introduced to the dashboard of the Boards of Indian companies. The 
industry has responded positively to the reform measure undertaken by the government with a 
wide interest across the public and private sector, Indian and multinational companies. 
The practice of CSR is not new to companies in India. However, what this Act does is bring 
more companies into the fold. Also, it is likely that the total CSR spends will increase. What is

does sustainable development entail? There are many definitions of sustainable development, but perhaps the 
most articulate is the 1987 one provided by the World 
Commission on Environment and Development’s (the Brundtland Commission) report, Our Common Future:

The history of our times will be remembered as one of the most challenging 
phases for the financial services industry. Given the constantly changing business 
environment, with frequent changes in regulations, the industry is struggling to 
build sustainable models.
Penetration of financial products and services has remained concentrated in 
the metros and Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, without percolating down to the smaller 
towns and cities and the rural belt. The good news is that while there is a huge 
need for services in these segments, it is just that these customers are not aware 
of the right products and the right channel to leverage for the products. It has

The ERP may be viewed as ‘risk compensation’ for investing in

ERP has numerous applications: valuation of companies, capital 
budgeting and even economic policymaking. Several papers 
have attempted to determine the ERP for developed markets, 
notably the US. The most widely used method for determining

hypothesis that excess returns earned in the past serve as a 
reasonable parameter for excess returns that can be expected 
in the future. While the historical metho..."

Coal mining
Is private participation the answer?

Foreword
Coal, with a proven  reserve of 860 billion tonnes is the most mined 
mineral in the world. Also, the demand curve for this sector is continuously rising. Major factors leading to a rise in the demand include the growing power sector in countries such as India and China and rising steel production. Additionally, stringent environment regulations, lead to delay in achieving production targets to match the demand from various sectors dependent on coal. 
The gap between demand and availability of coal in India is expected to 
rise every year. As per the 12th Plan, the estimated demand of coal will rise to 980 MT by 2016-17 and 1373 MT by 2021-22 while the supply of domestic coal is expected to be 795 MT by 2016-17 and 1102 MT by 2021-22. Today nearly 60% of the country’s total installed p..."
