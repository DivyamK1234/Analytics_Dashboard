Global Situation  
Through the first half of 2013, globally, the automotive industry has provided mixed signals, with significant investments 
announced in some markets being countered by ongoing cuts in others.  
While regions such as the d eveloping Asia -Pacific (2.24m illion and more ) and North America (770  thousand and more ) 
have contributed heavily, the d eveloped Asia -Pacific ( less than 859 thousand ) is expected to witness continued decline as 
assembly is localised abroad. Meanwhile, the world has been forced to wait for the European Union ( less than 500 
thousand ) to make its long -awaited reboun d,  not expected until early 2014 , at best . Long -term  projections expect these 
markets to stabili se and  with continued investment in developing regions, they are forecast to drive annual global light 
vehicle assembly past the 100 million  plateau for the first time ever, reaching 10 1 million units in 2017 with an impressive 
compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.02%.

Ever since the global economic crisis of 2008 -2009, the 
auto industry , globally has witnessed economic 
restructuring whose macro and micro -economic 
implications on nations and regions has been profound. 
There are several short - and long -term factors that 
contributed to the crisis. While the sudden collapse of sales 
in several markets was a short -term ( one-  to two -year 
timeframe) challenge for almost all automakers, loss of 
market share to increasing  competition in their domestic 
markets was another key challenge for automakers over the 
long term ( five to seven years) .  
Challenges faced by global automakers  currently  include 
the following:  
 Labour costs for workforce both current and 
retireesinclud ing wages, health insurance and 
pens ions (retirees)  Drop in industrial productivity due to lack of capital investment, ambiguous and dated 
labour laws  
 Product quality issues due to faulty component parts, 
etc. 
 Share -diminishing competition on new cars, mis-
match in e xisting product strategy for a market i.e 
presence only in a few segments of the market or 
region  
 Lack of R&D improvisations in existing and the  future 
product  
 Ageing of population and its impact on demand for 
new cars  
 Environmental concerns such as globa l warming, 
climate change and sustainability , both  positive or 
negative depending on how these are addressed  
 Slowdown in demand due to development of mass 
transit or alternative form of travel models in several

We provide a brief  review of the changes now underway in 
both developed (US, Germany and Japan) and developing 
automotive markets  (Brazil, Thailand) along with a brief 
review of the contributions by the auto industry to the 
national economies in these select countries.  We then 
outline  the changes taking place in the Indian industry and 
the remedial actions needed to meet employment needs of 
the Indian auto  industry in future.  
The current state of the US automotive industry  
The US sales and North American assembly markets 
continue to enjoy a renaissance of sorts, with numbers 
approaching pre -recession levels. The demand for new 
vehicl es in the US is leading the way; with a combination of 
an aged fleet, new models, and attractive financing . The US 
economy continues to be a headwind, but has yet to slow 
down demand.  
The US sales market continues to recover from its 
recessionary lows and is forecast to reach 15.5  million  
units in 2013, the first time the market will have eclipsed 
the 15 -million mark since 2007. While sales have rebound 
faster than anticipated, Autofacts  still believes sales will 
settle in  the range of 16  million to 17 million for the 
remainder of the decade.  
US consumers are also continuing to downsize their 
vehicles as high gas prices and rising MSRPs make smaller 
cars fiscally attractive on both fronts. Engines are also 
downsizing as consumers are finding the same 
performance and higher MPGs in smaller displacement 
engines. Transmissions are growing however as  eight -, 
nine -, and 10 -speed gearboxes are equipped and are 
further set to improve the fuel economy. Even luxury 
carmakers who have long pushed larger vehicles  are 
beginning to go small in the US.

Economic contribution  
Not since the early 1970s has the auto industry seen the 
levels of growth it has recently experienced –three straight 
years of at least 10 % increases in y-o-y sales.1 That is 
especially good news for a country where one  in every  17 
private -sector job is dependent on the auto industry.2 
While the automotive industry represents three  to 3.5 %  of 
the nation’s GDP , their outsized impact reverberates across 
the country. Last year, a report by a leading global financial 
services company found that nearly one -third of the 
country's entire economic gr owth was connected to auto 
sales.3 Preliminary Bureau of Labo ur Statistics (BLS) 
numbers show motor vehicle and parts manufacturing 
employment to be at its highest point in over four years, 
reaching 789,800 in March 2013.4 
Additional research found that the motor vehicle industry 
has the highest number of production worker hours and 
production worker wages, paying out nearly 22 billion USD 
annually.5  
Employment at motor vehicle and parts dealers recently 
reached a four -year high . The BLS preliminary report  
estimated almost 1.8 million dealer jobs in March 20136. 
Overall, from January 2011 to January 2013, motor vehicle 
and parts manufacturing added more than 95,000 jobs,

Market outlook  
Despite nebulous macroeconomic conditions as a whole, 
the auto industry continues to outperform and is helping 
drive an outsized portion of overall economic growth.

Statistics Administration, The Commerce Blog, "U.S. Manufacturing Continues To 
Create Jobs In The US,"  Economic performance i s anticipated to remain 
constrained through the remainder of 2013 before gaining 
momentum in 2014 to support continued growth in new 
vehicle demand.  
Sales growth is expected to remain strong throughout the 
second half of 2013 despite slow economic indicat ors. 
Strong product launches, historically low financing rates 
and an average fleet age now pushing 11 years should all 
help sustain this increase. The f ull-year US sales figures are 
expected to be around 15.5 million , a 7.6% increase from 
2012.  
A key regional manufacturing trend that has piqued 
industry interest is the ‘three -crew ’ or the ‘3-2-120’ shift 
pattern implemented at select D3 plants to help meet 
excess demand. This work routine has three crews working 
two shifts at 10 hours for six days a week. These shifts 
allow plants to produce more vehicles without reducing 
downtime for higher utilisation and efficiency.  
Another key trend that continues to be monitor ed is the 
increased locali sation of vehicle assembly within North 
America. This is p rimarily being driven by Asian OEMs 
looking to reduce the risk of currency volatility . European 
manufacturers are seen to be seeking a more stable (and 
growing) environment. Most of the forecast growth in 
North America will be due to these new plants comin g 
online. Given sustained sales growth and positive results in 
the region, the assembly now is anticipated to reach 16.1  
million units for 2013.

by 2.2 %,  the strongest quarter -onquarter growth since 
reunification in 1990.  
After the distortions created by the scrappage scheme in 
2009 and 2010, the German market has been more 
resilient than much of the rest of Europe due to a better 
economic performance. However, declining consumer and 
business confidence through 2012 and weakening 
economic growth have resulted in deteriorati ng  new car 
demand over the past year. Germany is the largest new car 
market in the EU and EFTA, typical ly accounting for over 
20% of all new car demand.  
The market was very strong in the first quarter of 2012, 
with the SAAR running at over 3.3  million  units. However, 
as concerns about the Eurozone grew and exports slowed, 
confidence levels and the German e conomy weakened.  
Demand fell by a further 12.9% in the first quarter of 2013 
with fewer selling days and a strong first quarter of 2012 
exaggerating the fall. As expected, Q2 was better with a 
decline of just 3.7%.  However, given that the GfK consumer 
index recorded its highest reading in June since September 
2007, the market remains stubbornly weak.  Part of the 
explanation could lie with consumers deferring purchases 
until after the elections in September, which could result in 
a relatively strong fourth  quarter.  
Economic contribution  
Germany witnessed a major increase in productivity for the 
last decade. While the unit labour costs in the rest of 
Europe increased, Germany’s labour costs decreased by a n 
yearly average of 0.4 % for the period 2004 to 2011 making 
both the country’s economy as well as its manufacturing 
more competitive. With a workforce of over 40 million 
people, it  is one of the largest ready labour market s in the 
EU. Nearly 80 % of this workforce has received formal 
vocational training or ha s an academic degree. One of the 
key reasons for having a highly skilled workforce is its 
unique dual education system , where students get benefits 
of classroom based learning coupled with on-the-job 
training over a period of two to three years. Over 350 
occupations are recogni sed by the system whose strict 
training standards are set by the German Chambers of 
Industry and Commerces (IHKs) across the country.

In April 2013 , the German automotive industry had a 
regular workforce of 750,500 ( higher than 2% ). Of these, 
430,100 were employed in the m anufacturer group I 
(motor vehicles and engines), 31,400 in the m anufacturer 
group II (trailer s, bodies and buses) and 289,000 in the 
manufacturer group III (parts and accessories). This 
means that the increase in employment observed since 
January 2011 is continuing. Each month since the 
beginning of 2011 has brought y-o-y  growth.10  
According to t he OECD report11 in 2011, some 517,000 
students at more than 420 universities  embarked on a 
course of academic study. Technical fields of study 
experienced an undergraduate enrollment level increase of 
more than  8%. Germany’s share of university students i n 
the sciences, mathematics, computer sciences, and 
engineering is the third highest in the EU, with 31 % of all 
students. German universities have introduced 
postgraduate and undergraduate degrees for improved 
international acceptance and comparison.

Market outlook  
Despite near -record lows in unemployment and a six -year 
high in consumer confidence, results have been lukewarm 
at best in 2013. New vehicle demand fell by 4.7% in June, 
and 8.1% YTD. The upcoming elections in September may 
be cause for deferring any large  purchases, so an 
improvement in sales is quite possible in Q4 of this year. 
Given the listless state of affairs in the region, a marginal 
decrease in sales demand is anticipated for new vehicles in 
Q3 with a slight growth expected by Q4 at the regional 
level. Select countries and OEMs are found to be struggling 
to keep up with demand while others battled overcapacity. 
The slightly improved demand outlook is cause for 
confidence that the worst has passed with s elect German OEMs planning additional production days through the 
summer holiday, while other OEMs are increasing their 
output of top -selling models. Moderate growth is expected 
for 2014, though continued austerity measures will likely 
confine the strength  of market recovery.  
Current state of the industry in Japan  
Demand in Japan remains lower in 2013 after the eco -car 
cash incentive ended in September 2012. Consumers may 
be enticed to make big -ticket purchases before sales tax 
increases from 5 to 8% in Ap ril 2014 . Sales could thus see 
an upswing towards the end of the year and into Q1 2014. 
Hybrid  vehicles and mini vehicles are increasingly 
becoming popular in Japan, fuelled by the recent cash and 
on-going tax incentives. Competitions in these two 
segments  are expected to be more intense in 2013 as new 
key models will be introduced from various automakers 
towards the end of the year. The yen has weakened against 
the US dollar over the last several months, translating into 
a positive financial effect for Jap anese automakers. Yet, it 
is still stronger than the optimal level . Some automakers 
have adjusted their manufacturing strategy in order to 
keep high volume program mes in Japan until demands 
become much higher for those models in key overseas 
market s. 
Econo mic contribution   
Automobiles are the focus of an extremely wide range of 
industrial and related activity, from materials supply and 
vehicle production to sales, servicing, freight shipping and 
other auto -centered operations. Auto -related  employment 
in Japan at present amounts to 5.48 million people.12

Market outlook

in the first five months of 2013, even as monetary and 
fiscal policies seem to be reviving the country’s economy. 
April showed signs of hope with slight growth of 2%, the 
first positive result sin ce September of 2012 when

government -funded cash incentives ended. However, May 
sales numbers returned to a downward trend and the 
overall contraction is expected to carry through the 
remainder of the year. Consumers may be enticed to make 
big-ticket purch ases before the sales tax increases from 5 to 
8% in April 2014, so sales could see an upswing towards 
the end of the year and into Q1 2014.  
Although the yen has relatively weakened  Japanese 
automakers are expected to locali se more assembly 
volumes oversea s in order to avoid risks of currency 
fluctuations. Therefore, excess capacity should be a major 
issue in Japan.  In the mid to long  term, this region is 
expected to see assembly volume decline due to a 
combination of continuing assembly transfers to overse as 
and stagnant domestic markets. Japanese automakers have 
started announcing their capacity reduction plans, yet the 
regional utili sation is expected to remain below 90% which 
can lead to further capacity reduction.  
Current state of industry in Brazil  
The Brazilian auto sector has experienced incredible 
growth in the last few years now representing the  fourth  
largest  sales market globally. However this growth has 
drawn attention to the weakness of its local assembly as 
evidenced by increasing reliance on imports to meet 
demand. From 2005 to 2011 , the market averaged 12 % 
annual growth while imports witnessed a staggeri ng 
growth of 46 %  annual growth rate. By 2011 , imports 
represented nearly 26 %  domestic sales.  
First effects of the financial crisis were felt during the 
contraction of the economy in the beginning of 2012. To 
revive the economy and stimulate consumption , the 
Brazilian government adopted a package of measures for 
few sectors including the automotive sector known for its 
dynamic effects on the other sectors of the economy. Some 
of those measures include  the following : 
Reduction in excise tax (IPI) on the pur chase of cars and 
light commercial vehicles in addition to a reduction in the 
tax on financial transactions (IOF) in loans to individuals 
from 2.5  to 1.5 %  a year. While 1.0 litre vehicles ha ve their 
excise tax reduced from 7 % to zero,  vehicles with engin es 
between 1 and 2 litres had their excise tax reduction from 
11 to 5.5 % (for vehicles with flex fuel technology) and from 
13.5 6.5 % (gasoline). Thus in both cases, excise duty was 
reduced by half. Also , the excise duty on light commercial 
vehicles was red uced from 4 to 1 %. This resulted in a surge 
in vehicle sales between June and December which helped 
the industry close recover from a slump of 4.4 % before the measures being implemented, to close the year with a 
growth of 6.1 %.  
After the introduction of s everal different versions of the 
Innovar Auto legislation and negotiations with industry 
participants, the Brazilian government passed a decree in 
October 2012, paving the way for Inovar policy to take 
effect from 2013 onwards.

Market outlook  
Brazil’s light vehicle production is on pace for record levels, 
with the  first half of 2013 far outpacing the sluggish pace of 
2012. Full -year assembly is expected to reach 3.4  million  
units for 2013, with growth continuing at a more modest 
pace of 3.5% in 2014. In the mid  term, South America as a 
whole is expected to hit the 5 million  mark in 2015, but 
short -term production stability in the region remains

heavily dependent on when civil unrest in Brazil subsides, 
especially with the World Cup and Olympics on the 
horizon.  
New light vehicle registrations in Brazil reached 1.35  
million  units between January and June. While lower 
vehicle taxes have helped ease concerns over credit 
availability, political and social unrest will serve to 
constrain growth , particularly at the rate seen in the first 
five months of the year. While any q uantifiable impact of 
recent demonstrations and riots remains to be seen, sales 
will likely pull back, suggesting a full -year growth rate of 
just under 4%.

launched a stimulus program me in 2012.Under th is 
program me, first-time passenger car buyers were entitled 
to up to 100,000 baht (3,300  USD ) in tax rebates. The tax 
rebates boosted Thailand's car sales to a record high of 1.43 
million units in 2012, an 80% jump from 2011.  
Production in the first half of this increased by over 26.35 % 
y-o-y to reach 1.34 million units.13 Of the overall car 
production, a total of 540,303 units, 40.29 %  were

Economic contribution  
The a utomotive industry is Thailand’s second -largest 
export industry, after computer parts and components. 
Thanks to continuous government support, it has evolved 
into an industry with vibrant foreign OEM   competition 
and an extensive network of supporting indu stries 
including several small and medium -sized industrial firms. 
Thailand’s long experience with automotive manufacturing 
has equipped the country with a comparatively low -cost yet 
experienced labo ur force for the sector. Apart from 
launching industry -friendly policies focus sed on 
investment privileges and excise -tax benefits, the 
government also supports environmental friendliness, and 
development of the workforce . This makes it an ideal 
manufacturing location for eco -cars and one -tonne pickup 
trucks.

According to forecasts by the Auto Parts Industry Club and 
TAPMA, the automobile industry is likely to continue 
growing and Thailand is expected to be assembling 2.5 
million automobiles a year by 2015. Provided the trend 
continues, the country should produce about 3.2 million 
vehicles annually in 2020 (as a result  of many government 
support program mes, including the  eco car project).14  
According to a survey of members of the Auto Parts Club 
and TAPMA, the industry employed 457,000 workers in 
2010 when automobile production stood at 1.6 million 
units. This put the productivity figure at 3.5 vehicles per 
worker.15

 Market outlook  
According to the forecast of the Thai Automotive 
Federation, automakers are likely to produce 2.55 million 
vehicles this year, a slight improvement from 2.45 million 
in 2012. Overall output in the first half of this year rose 
26.35% from a year earlier to 1.34 million units. On the 
sales front , domestic demand still looks weaker resulting 
from the withdrawal of subsidies by the government. 
However with the introduction of newer ec0 -car models, 
there could be intense competition in the sub -compact car 
segment during the second half of this year t hat could see 
the year ending with sales of nearly 1.3 million units.  
Current state of the i ndustry in India  
The m arket performance in India during 2009 and 2010 
was underpinned by natural demand driven by the 
country’s economic performance, growing middle  class and 
low levels of vehicle ownership. Lower levels of economic 
growth, combined with rising petrol prices and high 
interest rates have created strong headwinds for the Indian 
vehicle market, and volatility in petrol and diesel prices has 
added to unc ertainty in the buying decision.  
The increase in excise duty on utility vehicles put a further 
body blow on the growing SUV segment. As a result, the 
Indian passenger vehicle market has fallen consecutively 
month over month (April to July) for the past fou r months. 
Block closures have become a regular feature as carmakers 
contend with the rapid slowdown in the demand for cars. 
Several automakers are now periodically reducing 
production schedules to better align production with 
demand.  
The l ong-term outlook  for the Indian market has also been 
revised as it is clear that India still faces significant hurdles 
on the road to greater levels of motorisation, likely to be 
resolved over a longer 10 - to 20-year planning horizon.  
Economic contribution  
With 6.7% contr ibution to India’s GDP, the automobile 
industry is one of the key manufacturing sectors in India. 
India is currently the sixth largest passenger car producer 
in the world with an annual turnover of around 55  billion 
USD in FY 2013 and employs around 18.5  million  people 
(directly and indirectly). Direct employment includes 
personnel working with automobile OEMs and auto 
component manufacturers (about 30% to 40%). Indirect 
employment includes personnel working in enabling 
industries, such as vehicle finance  and insurance, vehicle 
repair, vehicle service stations, vehicle maintenance,

Market outlook  
In the last few years , the passenger vehicle industry was 
largely driven by strong economic growth. However, a host 
of domestic factors in the form of increasing fuel prices, the 
weakening rupee and prolonged high interest rates led to 
rising vehicle financing costs, thus leadi ng to a slowdown 
in the demand for cars.  While the demand for micro  or 
small SUVs provided a boost to India's passenger vehicle 
market, passenger car sales fell during FY 2013 for the first 
time in a decade by 6.7% to 1.9  million  units. Despite 
OEMs launch ing 22 special editions in the previous 
months, giving interest -free repayment and discounts up to 
20% to catch customers at dealerships, the car industry 
faces the decade’s worst slowdown.

After more than 10 years of steady output growth, India’s 
production is forecast to fall by around 3% to 3.33 million 
units for the current year. Accordingly, excess capacity is 
expected to reach a record high of 2.5 million in the current 
year making capa city utilisation fall to 57%, representing 
the lowest level for more than a decade.  
Just two years ago , India was seen as the world's hottest 
growth market after China and major OEMs invested in 
capacity expansion. Within these two years, assembly 
capacity in India rose by around 25% to over 5.8  million  
units in 2013.  To keep pace with slowing demand and 
bridge the gap between sales and output, leading OEMs 
scaled back their production recently and block closures 
have become a regular theme in India . At least 50  to 60 
days of production days have been lost as companies are 
now shutting down production at their plants to cope with 
an inventory pile -up at stockyards and dealerships in the 
past six  to eight  months.

Although demand for vehicles in India increased over the 
past years, motorisation in India in terms of vehicle 
penetration and sales per capita is still among the lowest 
compared to other marke ts. However, low car penetration 
coupled with a huge population and a growing middle class 
with increasing purchasing power makes India still a high potential growth market for major OEMs to keep investing 
in.    
India: Vehicles (PC+CV) per capita and  vehicle density  
2011   
 
Source: Autofacts analysis, VDA  
With a vehicle density per 1000 population at around 22.5 
and vehicle sales per 1000 at 2.73, India falls far behind 
other emerging markets.  Vehicle sales remains low largely 
due to relatively low per capita income levels combined 
with high acquisition costs and increasing fuel prices. One 
of the key growth drivers was the strategy by automakers to 
build a range of cheap, smaller and more fuel -efficient  and 
affordable cars to cater not only to local cu stomers, but 
also to use India as an export hub for small car 
manufacturing. To assemble these low -margin vehicles 
profitably, car manufacturer s are investing in local 
production to cut costs and ramp up volumes with exports 
seen as an opportunity to expan d the volume base and 
create scale.  
Reflection : Are we facing a crisis or is it a n 
opportunity in disguise?  
One of the key concerns whenever the auto industry is hit 
by slowdown is whether it is capable of a rebound and how 
long the slowdown will last. During the financial crisis of 
2009 , governments in the US, the EU and Japan 
responded by announcing policy  interventions   that have 
helped revive both the industry as well as the economy. 
These in turn led to benefits such as an economic stimulus, 
reducti on in vehicle emissions and improvements in 
vehicle safety.

The preceding reviews of the global automotive markets 
highlight the fact that a crisis situation needs dynamic 
policy intervention.  
The Indian g overnment had introduced a range o f 
measures such a s cuts in customs and excise duty 
(including auto components to be used in hybrid vehicles), 
stimulus package encouraging soft loans to compensate 
tight lending and softening of oil prices in order to boost 
consumer demand for automobiles. To stimulate dem and 
for new vehicles, the Indian government needs to  
announce a scrappage scheme for vehicle owners to replace 
older automobiles by extending 50% rebate on excise and 
sales tax on the lines of European nations. The government 
needs to also explore a scrappage incentive to replace all 
vehicles that are 10 to 15 years old. Besides stimulating 
demand , it will also help control air pollution and reduc e 
fuel consumption.  
The workforce needs to be trained to meet the demands of 
the industry in the long term . Availability of skilled 
manpower has always been a key competitive advantage 
for both automakers and suppliers. According to SIAM 
estimates , the direct employment in the industry is close to 
13 million. However , for this number to be sustainable over 
the long term (7  to 10 years) , another 35 million are needed 
for employment in the industry.16 Industry associations 
SIAM, ACMA and FADA have taken the first and crucial 
step to set up an Automotive Skill Development Council 
(ASDC), which  is yet to be  fully o perational. To meet long -
term objectives , remedial actions are needed .

16 NSDC Skill gap analysis report  on Auto and auto component Industry in India  service and support functions. To address these gaps , a 
common roadmap and a national level assessment of skills, 
training development program mes and technica l 
certification need to be identified. A national level 
certification or a vocational qualification will enable 
companies to source from a common talent pool having 
similar skillsets.  
Graduates of ITIs, engineering colleges and other 
institut ions are not readily employable and need retraining 
at substantial costs in order to be come  employable. Few 
companies have already taken a leadership role in ITIs, 
partnering colleges, establishing their own training cent res, 
and working with NGOs and other training partners to 
retrain persons who could be recruited.  
The ASDC can take the lead in establishing the much -
needed academia -industry connect by encouraging 
internship opportunities at all major auto production hubs 
in the country. It needs to also adopt a collaborative 
approach to training that is inclusive of manufacturers and 
dealerships, develop online training resources and focus on 
increasing practical components in the courses in order to 
enhance the hands -on sk ills of students.  
Key work areas and skill sets that will be in demand in the 
long term need to be identified such as drivers, service 
mechanics, salespersons and manufacturing workers. For 
each area, a hierarchy needs to be established, different 
levels o f competencies need to be determined and  a 
national curriculum framework devised.  
Conclusion  
The differences in the structure of the automotive industry 
in India and other developed countries (US, EU and Japan) 
are indeed immense. However , we can learn fro m the 
policy approaches adopted by the industry there and 
develop a mechanism or framework that insulates the 
Indian industry against future economic shocks. All 
industry stakeholders must learn to integrate different 
approaches . in order to build efficien t capacity at their 
plants and improve employee skills. The know -how which 
exists among a few must be diffused and shared among all 
so that the entire industry works in the same direction in 
order to build a business based model that has scale and 
sustainability .
