 4February 2025 Union Budget 2025Foreword
Continuing with the momentum initiated in July 2024, the current set of proposals aims to streamline business 
operations and enhance predictability. It's refreshing to see the government addressing the challenges of the middle class amidst the economic slowdown. This budget is strategically designed to stimulate spending and drive economic growth, as reflected in the revised individual tax rates.
For professionals in the fund industry, reduced complexity and certainty are extremely important. Simplified tax rules, 
such as clearer guidelines on capital gains and the removal of the 0.1% securities purchase tax, mark a step in the 
right direction.
On a broader policy level, there are multiple forward-looking initiatives, such as the GCC framework for Tier 2 cities, 100% foreign investment in insurance, and reinvigorating urban infrastructure, among others.
Finally, on the much -awaited new tax law, the Hon'ble Finance Minister has wisely opted for refinement rather than 
upheaval, prioritizing simplification over radical changes. This thoughtful approach is designed to facilitate smoother 
transitions and foster a more favorable business environment.
