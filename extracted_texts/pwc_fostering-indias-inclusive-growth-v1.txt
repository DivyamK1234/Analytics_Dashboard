PwC  |  Fostering India’s Inclusive Growth6India is expected to remain fastest growing major economy in the world
Robust growth in domestic consumption and exports but slowdown in urban 
demand and investment in FY25As per the first advance estimates, India’s economic growth is expected to moderate to 6.4% in financial 
year (FY) 2025 compared to 8.2% growth in FY24, mainly due to slowdown in urban consumption, high 
food inflation, slow growth in capital formation and global headwinds. However, India is expected to 
remain the world’s fastest growing in 2025, supported by a strong domestic market, rising working age 
population and strong macroeconomic fundamentals.
Government consumption growth is estimated to improve in FY25 given the increase in the revenue 
expenditures of both State and Union Governments, while private consumption growth is expected to be 
driven by rural demand, easing inflation and a favourable base. However, high frequency indicators such 
as passenger vehicle sales and Fast Moving Consumer Goods reflect weakness in urban demand. Exports 
are also expected to witness strong growth supported by robust growth in services exports. Investment 
growth is expected to drop slightly in FY25 due to slowdown in capital expenditure at both the state and 
central government level as well as due to a lack of pick-up in private investment.Annual GDP growth at constant prices

downside risks to the growth that emerge 
primarily from the external sector. Inflation 
is expected to moderate to an average 
of 4.5% in FY26, aided by a favourable 
food inflation with good harvest and 
normal monsoon expected and softening 
commodity prices. The exchange rate, 
which has been under pressure, should 
improve, as the volatility in Foreign Portfolio

Tax rates
•	Income-tax rates (including surcharge and health and education cess) for individuals to remain 
unchanged for taxpayers opting for the old tax regime.
•	For assessment year (AY) 2026–27, tax slabs for the New Personal Tax Regime (NPTR) are set out below:
•	Tax rebate is proposed to be enhanced from INR 25,000 to INR 60,000 having an effect of Nil tax liability 
up to total income of INR 12,00,000.
•	No change in corporate income-tax rates.
PwC  |  Fostering India’s Inclusive Growth7Income Tax
Key takeaways: 
•	The revised tax slabs are expected to reduce the financial burden for the middle class, giving them 
more disposable income which will help in boosting household consumption, increasing personal 
savings, and spurring investment.
•	Salaried taxpayers earning income up to INR 12,75,000 need to pay zero tax as per the revised tax 
slabs under NPTR.
PwC  |  Fostering India’s Inclusive Growth8•	Specific changes in effective Basic Customs Duty (BCD) rate from 2 February 2025 are to be brought 
forth to correct the inverted duty structure:
•	Only one cess [either Social Welfare Surcharge 
(SWS) or Agriculture Infrastructure and 
Development Cess (AIDC)] is to be levied on any 
product to ensure same effective Customs duty 
where the BCD rate slabs are realigned.
•	Exemptions from SWS rate from  
2 February 2025 are provided for 82 Tariff Lines, 
such as the following:
 –Solar cells
 –Luminaries and lighting fittings, including 
searchlights and spotlights and parts  
thereof, etc.
 –Parts of electronic toys
 –Solar module and other semiconductor devices 
and photovoltaic cells
 –Motor vehicles for transport of ten or more 
persons
 –Motor vehicles for transport of goods. Motor 
cars other than Completely Built Units (CBU) 
with CIF value exceeding USD 40,000.
•	35 and 28 new specified capital goods for use in 
manufacture of EV and mobile phone industry, 
respectively, are added in the list of exempted 
capital goods.Customs

exemption notifications, out of 25 entries, 24 are 
retained and 1 entry is removed. Therefore, with 
effect from 1 April 2025, 20% BCD to apply on 
heat coil for use in the manufacture of electrical 
kitchen chimneys.
•	Extension of export timeline and added duty-
free inputs to industries such as handicraft. The 
leather and marine industry also benefit from 
reduced BCD to promote manufacturing and 
exports.
•	Rate of AIDC is increased with effect from  
2 February 2025 on certain goods, such as the 
following:
 –Specified footwear – from Nil to 18.5%
 –Solar Cells – Nil to 7.5%
 –Specified motor vehicles of Headings 8702, 
8703 and 8704 – Nil to 20%/ 67.5%.
 –Laboratory chemicals – Nil to 70%
 –Luminaries and lighting fittings – Nil to 5%.
Key takeaway: The government continues with its objective to reduce the tax complexity and 
rationalisation of inverted duty structure to facilitate Make in India.
PwC  |  Fostering India’s Inclusive Growth9Widening and deepening of tax base
Tax certainty•	To encourage voluntary compliance, the time limit to file an updated return of income is extended 
from 24 months to 48 months from the end of the Assessment Year (AY). The additional tax outflow is 
tabulated below:
•	With effect from 1 April 2025, it is proposed that no fresh lease of eight years to be available to 
accumulated losses in a merger/amalgamation. Losses to be allowable for the unexpired period only.
•	The scope of definition of Virtual Digital Assets (VDAs) is proposed to be expanded to include 
any crypto-asset, being a digital representation of value that relies on a cryptographically secured 
distributed ledger or a similar technology to validate and secure transactions.Income Tax
Time Period Additional Tax
Upto 12 months 25%
After 12 months and upto 24 months 50%
After 24 months and upto 36 months 60%
After 36 months and upto 48 months 70%
Key takeaways:
•	Enhanced time limit to file updated tax return will encourage taxpayers to self rectify mistakes and 
avoid protracted tax litigation.
•	Limiting the set off of accumulated losses would impact cost benefit of amalgamations for the 
industrial undertakings that have accumulated losses.
•	Seemingly, the definition of VDA has been expanded to align it with the definition of ‘crypto asset’ 
mentioned in the OECD’s Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework.
•	Scope of safe harbour rules to be expanded. 
Detailed rules are awaited.
•	Investments held by investment funds  
[Category I or II Alternative Investment Fund 
(AIFs)] are deemed to be ‘capital assets’.
•	Long-term capital gains (LTCG) on the sale of 
unlisted debt investments (whether or not such 
capital gains are deemed to be short-term under 
the current provisions) are to continue to qualify 
for the exemption available to Sovereign Wealth 
Funds (SWFs) and Pension Funds (PFs).•	LTCG arising in the hands of Real Estate 
Investment Trust and Infrastructure Investment 
Trust upon the sale of listed shares are to be 
taxed at a concessional rate of 12.5%.
•	To augment the government’s Semicon India 
Programme, presumptive taxation is proposed 
to be introduced for non-residents providing 
services or technology to resident companies for 
setting up an electronics manufacturing facility.

 –It is clarified in the frequently asked questions introduced post the Budget that services provided by 
technical personnel is also part of the presumptive scheme.
•	It is proposed to clarify that a Significant Economic Presence (SEP) will not constitute for a transaction 
confined to the purchase of goods in India for the purpose of export.
•	A new provision is introduced, which allows importers and exporters to voluntarily revise the entries, 
post clearances. Based on the revisions, the importer or exporter is allowed to either avail refund of 
excess duty paid or make payment of differential duties and interest (but without penalty), in case of 
excess or short payment of duty at the original instance, respectively. However, this revision is not 
allowed in specified cases, e.g. investigation, audit and re-assessment.
•	Extension of specific conditional BCD exemptions (Notification No. 50/2017 - Customs dated  
30 June 2017) is extended beyond 31 March 2025 for a one- to ten-year periods as set out below:CustomsKey takeaways:
•	Year after year, the government has consistently focused on promoting manufacturing in India, 
simplifying tax laws and providing tax certainty. This year is no exception. Apart from harmonising 
the SEP provisions with the concept of ‘business connection’, this new presumptive scheme offers 
greater tax certainty, helps in determining the tax costs upfront and lowers the risk of protracted 
tax litigation. 
•	The extension of sunset date for tax exemptions on investments made by SWFs and PFs will 
significantly aid in boosting investment and growth in the infrastructure sector.
•	The expansion of safe harbour provisions aims to reduce litigation and provide greater certainty in 
international taxation, which could certainly impact Global capability centers.
Key takeaway: Tax certainty is a key pillar of trade facilitation. Based on stakeholders’ consultations, 
the proposed measures endeavour to encourage voluntary compliances to avoid possible dispute in 
the future and also extend status quo on critical exemptions.
PwC  |  Fostering India’s Inclusive Growth11•	With a view to nullify the impact of the recent judgement by the Supreme Court in the case of  
Safari Retreat1, the phrase ‘plant or machinery’ is proposed to be replaced with ‘plant and machinery’ in 
section 17(5)(d) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017 (CGST Act), retrospectively from  
1 July 2017. A new entry is inserted in Schedule III retrospectively from 1 July 2017. 
•	Supply of goods warehoused in a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) or Free Trade Warehouse Zone (FTWZ) 
to any person before clearance for exports or to the Domestic Tariff Area are deemed to be not supply. 
No refund can be claimed in respect of any tax previously paid in this regard.
•	Provisions in relation to time of supply of vouchers are omitted, in view of the intention of the 
government not to treat transaction in vouchers as supply.
1 Civil Appeal No. 2948 of 2023 dated 3 October 2024GST
Rationalisation and simplification
•	Presently, the annual value of a self-occupied 
house property which cannot be occupied by the 
owner is considered ‘Nil’ if there are specified 
reasons. Amendments are now proposed to 
provide that the annual value of the property is  
to be considered Nil if it is not self-occupied for 
any reason. 
•	Block assessment for transfer pricing 
assessment proceedings
 –Changes are proposed in the existing transfer 
pricing assessment provisions to introduce 
multi-year ALP determination. 
 –The proposed amendment provides that the 
ALP for an international transaction for any 
year will apply to a similar transaction for the 
next two consecutive years.Income Tax
 –The taxpayer needs to opt for block 
assessment. The option will be subject to the 
validation and subsequent examination of 
the ALP by the Transfer Pricing Officer (TPO). 
The form, manner and timelines are to be 
prescribed.
 –These changes are to take effect from  
1 April 2026.
•	Deemed dividend provisions are to be relaxed on 
a loan or advance by a Finance Company / Unit 
undertaking treasury activities in the IFSC, to its 
group entity listed outside India. Conditions in 
this regard are to be prescribed.Key takeaway: The amendment aimed at nullifying the impact of Supreme Court judgement, would 
have significant implications for industry stakeholders, particularly concerning blocked input tax 
credits on buildings and civil structures. Businesses are to promptly conduct thorough assessment 
of the impacted assets to determine if they qualify as ‘plant and machinery’ under GST law, as this 
classification would maintain their eligibility for input tax credits. The insertion of the new entry in 
Schedule III in respect of supply of goods warehoused in SEZ or FTWZ seems to settle the issue 
once and for all and clearly clarifies the intention of the government not to treat such transactions as 
a supply.

•	The threshold limit for Taxes Collected at Source 
(TCS) under the Liberalised Remittance Scheme 
(LRS) and for sellers of overseas tour packages 
is proposed to be reduced from INR 0.7m to 1m. 
TCS provisions on the sale of goods to not apply 
with effect from 1 April 2025. For details, kindly 
refer to Annexure – B.
•	The period for processing of immunity 
applications by the tax officer is extended from 
one month to three months from the end of 
the month in which the tax officer receives the 
application.
•	The time limit to pass the penalty order is 
rationalised to six months from the end of the 
relevant quarter in which –  –proceedings pursuant to which the penalty is 
initiated are completed; or
 –revision order is passed; or
 –order is received by the relevant authorities, in 
case of appeal; or
 –notice of penalty initiation is issued.
•	For computing the limitation period for various 
proceedings, the commencement date and 
the end date is clarified with regard to the stay 
granted by court. The period beginning from the 
date of grant of stay order by any court till the 
receipt of the certified copy of the order vacating 
the stay by jurisdictional Principal Commissioner 
or Commissioner, is to be excluded.
Key takeaways:
•	Introduction of block assessment for transfer pricing proceedings is in line with international tax 
practices and would result in releasing significant administrative burden for the taxpayers. Rules in 
this regard are currently awaited, and it will be an interesting space to watch out for.
•	The amendments related to TDS / TCS aims at improving cash flow for businesses, particularly 
for small and medium enterprises, while ensuring that tax collection remains robust and targeted 
towards significant transactions.

•	Rationalisation of existing Customs duty rate slabs from 15 to 8, including zero rate, with effect from 
1 May 2025 are to be carried out as follows:
 –Existing tariff rate from 25%, 30%, 40% is changed to 20%.
 –Existing tariff rate from 150%, 120% and 100% is changed to 70%.
•	Re-alignments in Customs Tariff Act, 1975 notified with effect from 1 May 2025 in terms of the following:
 –Creation of new Tariff lines and explanations in certain chapters (Chapter 29, 38).
 –Alignment with the Explanatory Notes of HSN 2022 (Chapter Note 2 to Chapter 85).Customs

Key takeaway: Realignment of duty slabs is expected to aid not only administration but is also a step 
towards a leaner duty structure which is predictable and easy for compliances.
PwC  |  Fostering India’s Inclusive Growth14•	Pre-deposit for cases involving only penalty (no tax demand involved) is revised as below:
 –Reduced from 25% to 10% of penalty for appeal before the appellate authority for cases under 
section 129(3) of the CGST Act.
 –For cases involving penalty other than under section 129(3) of the CGST Act, the pre-deposit is to be 
10% of the penalty at the appellate authority and Tribunal level.

•	Relaxation to be provided from invoking prosecution-related provisions in case of delayed deposit of 
TCS, up to the due date of filing the TCS return (akin to TDS provisions).Income TaxKey takeaway: Simplifying the company merger process can speed up integration, realize synergies 
faster, and reduce legal and administrative costs. Additionally, decriminalizing various provisions 
may create a more business-friendly environment, encouraging entrepreneurship, innovation, and 
economic growth.
Key takeaway: These are positive steps towards incentivising start-ups, reducing the risk of default 
and moderating the compliance burden for deductors or collectors of TDS or TCS.
PwC  |  Fostering India’s Inclusive Growth15•	To increase certainty through procedural ease, the following changes in Customs law are provided:
 –Provisional assessment to be finalised within a period of two years extendable on merits by one 
year, except in specified cases (e.g. when any information is being sought from an authority outside 
India through a legal process, an appeal in similar matter of the same person is pending before any 
Appellate Tribunal, High Court, Supreme Court, etc.). For pending provisional assessments, the period 
for finalisation is to be counted from the date of enactment of the Finance Act, 2025.
 –The Customs (Import of Goods at Concessional Rate of Duty or for Specified End Use), Rules 2022 
are revised to relax compliances, i.e. returns are to be filed quarterly instead of monthly, and the time 
period of utilisation of goods is extended from six months to one year.Customs
•	A high-level committee to review all non-financial sector regulations to strengthen trust-based economic

four months.
•	Uniform tax rate of 12.5% to be applicable on 
LTCG derived by Foreign Institutional Investors 
(FIIs) or other specified funds in securities other 
than listed equity shares.Key takeaway: The measures relating to relaxation of periodic compliances and ensuring closure of 
assessment in a time-bound manner are expected to reduce the compliance and business costs.
Key takeaway: Regularization and simplification of non-financial sector and FDI regulations are 
poised to create a more conducive environment for business operations and foreign investments. 
These changes are expected to drive economic growth, enhance competitiveness, and foster a more 
transparent and predictable regulatory landscape.

The Union Budget 2025 reinforces India’s growth agenda with a push for education, exports, 
consumption and regulatory reforms. The 6.65% increase in allocation for the education sector will 
accelerate skill development, aligning with the vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’. Measures to boost exports will 
drive GDP growth, creating more opportunities. The much-awaited tax relief for the middle class will 
enhance disposable income, stimulating demand and contributing to the desired level of economic 
growth. Overall, this budget supports economic momentum and strengthens the foundation for a 
digital-first, skill-driven economy to contribute to India’s progress.““

CFOA growth and consumption-oriented budget: Amendments ranging from the New Income Tax Bill are 
to be presented in the current session., exempting personal Income-tax up to INR 12,00,000/- under 
the new tax regime (which would result in increased expenditure towards personal consumption), 
multi-year arm’s length price determination from a transfer pricing perspective (in line with the 
provisions in developed countries) and rationalisation of withholding tax provisions and Customs duty 
rates – Strong step for India moving towards developed economy.““
Abhinav Sogani
Tata Consumer Products
Tax Head
The Indian Government’s Budget 2025 is focused on fostering growth and simplifying tax regulations. 
The increase in individual tax limits provides higher disposable income, boosting consumption. 
Rationalising TDS and TCS compliances enhance ease-of-doing business, supporting entrepreneurs. 
Extensions of the sunset clauses for sovereign wealth funds startups and IFSC units aim to attract 
investments. The introduction of a new Income Tax Bill promises to simplify the tax code. Not raising 
the capital gains tax rate and avoiding inheritance tax alleviate investor concerns, encouraging further 
investment. Overall, the budget balances economic growth, ease of compliance and investment 
promotion effectively.““

Budget 2025 has reaffirmed the government’s policy of tax certainty. Income-tax breaks to boost 
consumption should augur well for the economy. While we await the New Income Tax Bill, efforts to 
streamline TDS and TCS provisions should reduce compliance burden on corporates.“ “
