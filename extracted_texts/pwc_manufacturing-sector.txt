Our perspectiveManufacturing sector - 
A bird’s eye view
India’s manufacturing sector has 
witnessed robust growth over the 
past decade and is crucial to 
economic progress. It fosters job 
creation for the country’s workforce, 
especially in the unorganised strata. 
The sector’s significant contribution 
to exports also strengthens India’s 
global trade position. Streamlined 
tax policies and clarity in tax 
positions can help attract 
investment and nurture innovation.”Manufacturing sectorUnion Budget 2025
