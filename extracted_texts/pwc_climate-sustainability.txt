Key roadblocks and issues
Sustainable and clean energy projects continue 
to rely on a high-cost import source for raw 
materials, leading to longer gestation periods 
and volatility in import prices of raw materials. 
This impacts project costs and timelines.
Limited sources and high cost of capital are 
acting as a deterrent for new greenfield projects
There is a lack of adequate infrastructure such 
as efficient waste management systems and 
limited sources of reliable clean energy.Key expectations from Budget 2025

Our perspectiveA bird’s eye view 
Renewable energy capacity in India
Renewable energy and efficient 
waste management are twin pillars 
for combating climate change by 
boosting India’s energy security and 
reducing its dependence on fossil 
fuels. Targeted tax policy measures 
that cater to the renewable energy 
and waste management sector are 
critical to accelerate growth and 
meet the Government’s vision of a 
Viksit Bharat by 2047.”Climate and sustainabilityUnion Budget 2025
Tax incentives (either through 
tax holidays or a concessional 
rate of tax of 15%) for 
greenfield projects in the 
renewable energy sectorTax incentives to be 
provided to operators in the 
EV ecosystem (e.g. battery 
charging stations, battery 
storage or swapping entities)Focused tax incentives 
such as accelerated 
depreciation, enhanced 
deduction (up to 200%) 
on capex/R&D activities Tax benefits in the form of 
reduced taxes on interest 
payouts, capital gains for 
green bonds to enable 
cheaper access to financing
Tax exemption with 
respect to income earned 
from carbon credits and 
trading of other forms of 
renewable energy 
certificatesDeemed valuation rule of 
70:30 (for goods and services 
respectively) in respect of 
renewable energy projects to be 
abolished and valuation to be 
undertaken based on actualsInclusion of electricity 
within the ambit of GST 
to ensure seamless credit 
availability and lower 
costs to end consumersReduction in/exemption 
from customs duties on 
import of materials for 
setting up green hydrogen 
production plantsBy 2030, the clean energy market 
in India is likely to reach 
USD 80  billion given that the 
country intends to achieve 
net zero emissions by 2070.1
As of October 2024, India’s installed 
renewable energy capacity crossed 
200 GW. By 2030, this is targeted to 
grow up to 500  GW.

The lack of a favourable tax 
regime and incentives to promote 
cross-border technology transfers 
is another obstacle.
The absence of R&D incentives 
restricts technological innovations 
in the renewable energy sector. 
Since electricity is exempt from 
GST, piled up input tax credit 
contributes to increased costs.
