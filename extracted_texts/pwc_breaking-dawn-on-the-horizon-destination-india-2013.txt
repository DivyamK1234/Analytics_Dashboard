India has seen moderation in its growth rate from its 
previous peaks, but it still compares favourably with many other economies. The IMF forecasts that India’s GDP growth rate will be behind China in 2014, but still better than the collective growth rate of emerging and developing economies and advanced economies respectively. The Prime Minister’s Economic Advisory Committee also believes that India will register a growth rate of 5.3% in 2013-14.
The economy, however, is facing a few challenges at present. 
One among them is to maintain a healthy current account deficit. Exports have slowed with dampening demand in global markets, while import bills kept their momentum going, leading to a trade deficit. 
The government has pulled the reforms trigger in the economy 
by moving towards reducing subsides on petroleum and diesel, attracting FDI in retail, aviation and broadcasting, passing the new Companies Act in the Parliament and setting up the Cabinet Committee on Investment, amongst the slew of measures this year.

shows that India is not only one of the fastest growing economies 
of the world, but also the third largest in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. The report further projects that India is going to maintain its third position in PPP terms through 2050.India’s emerging middle, a segment of population below the 
middle class, provides a large untapped market. In India, about 
470 million people were in the Emerging Middle class in 2010 and they are expected to grow to 570 million people in 2021. This emerging middle class market in India is expected to constitute a 
trillion dollar market

Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     3Foreign investment 
in IndiaChapter 2
Foreign direct investment in to India
The Indian government had embarked on liberalising the 
regulatory framework, particularly foreign investment (FI), through the Statement on Industrial Policy of 1991. Since then, the regulatory environment in terms of foreign investment has been consistently eased to make it investor-friendly.
Under the current framework, FDI is permitted by all categories 
(of investors) and in all sectors except the following:
• Activities and sectors not open to private sector investment 
e.g. Atomic energy and Railway Transport [except mass rapid transport systems (MRTSs)]
• Lotteries, gambling and betting
• Agriculture (excluding floriculture, horticulture, apiculture, seed development, animal husbandry, pisciculture, aquaculture and cultivation of vegetables, mushrooms, etc. under controlled conditions and services related to agro and allied sectors)
• Plantations (excluding tea plantations)
• Real estate business (except construction development projects) or construction of farmhouses 
• Chit funds, nidhi companies or trading in transferable development rights
• Manufacturing of cigars, cheroots, cigarillos and cigarettes, tobacco and tobacco substitutes
FIs can be made in other sectors under the following:
• Approval route, i.e. by the government through the Foreign 
Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) under the Ministry of Finance or Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry or both
• Automatic route, i.e. no prior approvals from regulatory authorities but only post facto intimations to RBI through Authorized Bankers 
Approval route
A prior approval from the FIPB or the DIPP is required in cases of FI where the project does not qualify for the automatic route.
The following cases will fall under this category:• Specified sectors which require FIPB approval for FDI or for 
FDI beyond a prescribed sectoral cap (Refer page 5,6,8, and 9)
• Issue of shares for consideration other than cash i.e. issue of shares against import of capital goods/machinery /equipment and pre-operative/pre-incorporation expenses subject to compliance with certain stated conditions [except for capitalisation of an external commercial borrowing (ECB) due for repayment and interest on such an ECB, as well as technical knowhow fee or royalties due for payment]
• Investments by citizens and companies of Bangladesh  or Pakistan
• Investments in warrants and partly paid shares
• Investment in an Indian company engaged only in downstream investment activities for holding purposes or which does not have any operations or any downstream investments. Additionally,  a company which fulfils the 
criteria prescribed under the core investment companies 
(CICs) guidelines issued by the RBI will have to comply with 
the norms prescribed therein
The decision of the FIPB or DIPP is normally conveyed within 
four to six weeks from the date of submission of an application. A 
proposal for foreign investment is decided on a case-to-case basis on the merits of the case and according to the prescribed sectoral policy. Generally, preference is given to projects in high-priority industries and the infrastructure sector, those with export potential, large-scale employment opportunities, links with the agro sector, social relevance, or those relating to the infusion of capital and induction of technology. 
Foreign investment proposals under the FIPB route involving a 
total foreign equity inflow of more than 12 billion INR must be placed before the Cabinet Committee of External Affairs (CCEA) for further consideration.
Where an entity has an earlier FIPB or CCEA approval for an 
activity/ sector or sectoral caps, additional foreign investment in such an entity does not require prior approval from the FIPB or the CCEA, where subsequent to the earlier approval:
• either the activity or the sector, had been placed under the 
automatic route; or
• sectoral caps had been removed or increased (provided that such additional investment along with the original investment is within the current sectoral caps)
Automatic route
Generally, except in the cases mentioned above, all other cases of foreign investment fall under the automatic route and do not require prior approval of the FIPB or DIPP.
Computation of FDI
The Indian government had issued guidelines to calculate total FDI in an Indian company where sectoral caps apply. As per this policy, the total FDI in an Indian company will comprise the following:
• Direct investment by a foreign investor
• Indirect Foreign Investments (IFIs) through an Indian 
company owned or controlled by non-residents. Here ‘owned’ means more than 50% shareholding and ‘control’ means right to appoint a majority of the directors or to control the management or policy decisions including by virtue of their shareholding or management rights or shareholders agreements or voting agreements.
Further, for the computation of IFI, ‘FI will include all types of investments, i.e., FDI, investment by FIIs (holding as on 31 March), NRIs, ADRs, GDRs, foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs),convertible preference shares and convertible currency debentures regardless of whether the said investments have been made under Schedule 1, 2, 3 or 6 of FEMA (Transfer or Issue of Security by Persons Resident Outside India) Regulations.
4 PwCBroadly, the principle emerging under this policy aspect is that 
in case an Indian company is owned and controlled beneficially by resident Indian citizens (RICs), any downstream investment made will be considered as domestic investment and not counted towards foreign investment caps.
Further, any downstream investments made by an Indian 
company owned or controlled by non-residents would also be required to comply with sectoral caps and conditionalities. In this regard, RBI has issued circular incorporating the downstream investment policy guidelines issued by DIPP in 2009. Further, a statutory auditor would need to certify whether downstream investment is in compliance with the FDI Policy and FEMA provisions.
Foreign venture capital permitted to acquire securities under private arrangement
Foreign Venture Capital Investors (FVCIs) can invest in eligible securities (equity, equity linked instruments, debt, debt instruments, debentures of an IVCU or VCF, units of schemes or funds set up by a VCF) by private arrangement or purchase from a third party subject to compliance with certain conditions.
Foreign investment by qualified foreign investors
Qualified foreign investors (QFIs) are non- resident investors other than SEBI-registered FIIs and SEBI-registered FVCIs who meet the KYC requirements of SEBI.  
QFIs from FATF compliant jurisdictions and resident in a country 
that is a signatory to IOSCO’s MoU or a signatory of a bilateral MoU with SEBI have been permitted to invest in equity shares of listed Indian companies or equity shares of Indian companies offered to the public in India through SEBI-registered depository participants (DPs) or SEBI-registered brokers within an individual cap of 5 and 10% in aggregate of the paid-up capital of listed companies or both.
Further, QFIs can also purchase rupee denominated units of 
equity schemes of domestic mutual funds (MFs) on a repatriation basis and eligible corporate debt instruments, viz. listed non-convertible debentures (NCDs), listed bonds of Indian companies, listed units of MF debt schemes and ’to be listed’ corporate bonds directly from the issuer or through a registered stockbroker on a recognised stock exchange in India. QFIs are also permitted to acquire non-convertible debentures or bonds issued by NBFCs categorised as infrastructure finance companies (IFCs). 
FDI in limited liability partnerships
FDI up to 100% is permitted with prior government approval in limited liability partnerships engaged in sectors or activities currently eligible for 100% FDI under the automatic route. Such sectors/activities should not  have any sectoral or other FDI-linked conditions. Some of the conditions, subject to which FDI in LLP would be permitted, are as follows:
• Only cash contribution is permissible for FDI in LLPs.
• LLPs with FDI are not allowed to make downstream 
investments.
• LLP cannot raise ECB.
• FIIs and FVCIs cannot invest in LLPs.Investment through share acquisition
Non resident investors can acquire shares of an existing Indian company subject to compliance with sectoral conditions. Stock acquisition is permitted after a resolution to this effect has been passed by the board of directors of the company whose shares 
are being acquired. The acquisition will need to comply with 
valuation guidelines prescribed by RBI or SEBI from time to time.
Prior FIPB approval is required in all cases where either the 
control or ownership of the Indian company, engaged in a sector where FDI caps apply, is transferred to or acquired by a non-
resident entity.
Acquisition by way of share swap is also permitted with prior 
FIPB approval and is subject to valuation guidelines.
Prior approval of the RBI is no longer required for the following 
cases of share acquisitions:
• Acquisition of existing equity by residents from non-residents 
where the share price falls outside the prescribed valuation norms but complies with the pricing prescribed under SEBI regulations or guidelines
• Acquisition of equity by non-residents from residents under the following cases: 
 –Where the requisite approval of the FIPB has been obtained
 –Where prescribed pricing guidelines are not met but comply with SEBI pricing guidelines
 –Where the investee company is in the financial services sector
Valuation norms
Issue of shares to non-residents or transfers from resident to non-residents is subject to valuation guidelines as set out below:
• In case of transfer of shares from resident to non-resident, the 
consideration cannot be less than the amount determined as per discounted cash flow method in case of unlisted shares. However, if shares are listed, then the consideration price cannot be less than the price at which preferential allotment of shares can be made under SEBI guidelines. 
• In relation to a transfer of shares of an Indian company (listed or unlisted) from a non-resident to resident, the price cannot exceed the above mentioned price 
• Where non-residents (including NRIs) are making investments in an Indian company, by way of subscription to its Memorandum of Association, such investments may be made at face value subject to their eligibility to invest under the FDI scheme.
In relation to a transfer of shares of an Indian company (listed or unlisted) from a non-resident to resident, the price may not be more than the minimum price at which the transfer of shares can be made. 
Investment by foreign institutional investors (FIIs)
Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     5A registered FII may, through the SEBI, apply to the RBI for 
permission to purchase the shares and convertible debentures of an Indian company under the portfolio investment scheme.
FIIs are permitted by the RBI to purchase the shares or 
convertible debentures of an Indian company through registered brokers on recognised stock exchanges in India. They are also permitted to purchase the shares or convertible debentures of an Indian company through private placement or arrangement. The total holding by each FII and SEBI approved sub-account of FII cannot exceed 10% of the total paid-up equity capital or 10% of the paid-up value of each series of convertible debentures issued by an Indian company. Further, the total holdings of all FIIs or sub-accounts of FIIs added together cannot exceed 24% of the paid-up equity capital or the paid-up value of each series of convertible debentures. The limit of 24% may be increased to the specified sectoral cap or statutory ceiling, as applicable, by the concerned Indian company by passing a board of directors’ resolution, followed by the permission of the shareholders through a special resolution to that effect and immediate intimation to the RBI.
FIIs can now invest in the primary issues of NCDs or bonds only 
if their listing is committed to be done within 15 days of such an investment. FIIs can also subscribe to unlisted bonds or NCDs in case the issuing company is an infrastructure company.

Pradesh, Assam, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Manipur, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Daman & Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli (union territories).
Entry options
A foreign company looking to set up operations in India can consider the following options: 
Operating as an Indian company
Wholly-owned subsidiary company
A foreign company can set up a wholly owned subsidiary 
company in India to carry out its activities. Such a subsidiary 
is treated as an Indian resident and an Indian company for all 
Indian regulations (including income tax, Foreign Exchange Management Act,1999 and the Companies Act), despite being 100% foreign-owned. At least two members, for a private limited 
company, and seven members, for a public limited company, are 
mandatory.
Activities of such a company need to comply with the provisions 
of the FDI policy.
Joint venture with an Indian partner (equity participation)
Although a wholly owned subsidiary has proven to be the preferred option, foreign companies have also begun operations in India by forming strategic alliances with Indian partners. The trend is to choose a partner in the same area of activity or who brings synergy to the foreign investor’s plans for India. Sometimes joint ventures are also necessitated due to restrictions on foreign ownership in certain sectors.
The FI guidelines for investment in an Indian company have 
already been discussed above.
Limited liability partnership (LLP)
LLP is a new form of business structure in India. It combines the advantages of a company, such as being a separate legal entity having perpetual succession, with the benefits of organisational flexibility associated with a partnership. At least two partners are required to form an LLP and they have limited liability.
An LLP, with less compliance levels is comparatively easier to 
manage  than a company form of organisation. Further, an LLP is not subject to mandatory requirements applicable to a company with regard to provision of depreciation and transfer to reserves prior to distribution of profits (though Companies Act 2013 makes it voluntary for a company to transfer to reserves prior to distribution of profits, this would be applicable once it gets notified). As mentioned earlier, the FDI policy for LLPs has been notified making this a possible viable entity form for Indian business operations of foreign investors.The operational guidelines with respect to compliances to be undertaken with respect to FDI in an LLP are likely to be notified soon by the RBI.
Operating as a foreign company 
Liaison office
Setting up a liaison or representative office is a common practice 
for foreign companies seeking to enter the Indian market. The role of these offices is limited to collecting information about the market and providing information about the company and its products to prospective Indian customers. These offices act as listening and transmission posts and provide information between the foreign company and its Indian customers. A liaison office is not allowed to undertake anything other than liaison activities in India and cannot, therefore, earn any income in India, under the terms of approval granted by the RBI.
Additionally, one would need registration with Registrar of 
companies and reporting of details of Liaison office is required with Director General of Police under whose jurisdiction the LO is established.
Project office
Foreign companies planning to execute specific projects in India can set up temporary project and site offices here for this purpose. The RBI has granted general permission to a foreign entity for setting up a project office in India, subject to the fulfillment of conditions. The foreign entity needs only to provide a report to the jurisdictional regional office of the RBI giving the particulars of the project or contract. Additionally, one would need to report the details of project office with Director General of Police under whose jurisdiction the PO is established.
Branch office
Foreign companies engaged in manufacturing and trading activities abroad can set up branch offices in India for the following purposes, with the prior approval of the RBI:
• Export and import of goods
• Professional or consultancy services
• Research work in which the parent company is engaged to 
promote technical or financial collaboration between Indian companies and the parent company
• Representing the parent company in India and acting as a buying or selling agent in India
• IT and software development services in India
• Technical support for products supplied by the parent or group companies
• Acting as a foreign airline or shipping company
In general, manufacturing activity cannot be undertaken through a branch office. However, foreign companies can establish a branch office or unit for manufacturing in an SEZ subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions.
Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     11A foreign company which sets up a subsidiary in India can fund 
its Indian subsidiary through the channels mentioned below:
Equity capital
Equity shares refer to the common stock of a company. Equity 
capital comprises securities representing the equity ownership in 
a company, providing voting rights, and entitling the holder to a 
share of the company’s success through dividends and/or capital appreciation. In the event of liquidation, common stockholders have rights to a company’s assets only after bondholders, other 
debt holders, and preferred stockholders have been satisfied.
The issue of equity shares by an Indian company to a foreign 
company must comply with the sectoral caps as stated in the FDI policy of the Government of India.
Transfer to reserve rules
Corporate laws in India provide for a mandatory transfer of distributable profits to free reserves of the Indian company in the event of a dividend declaration. In the event that the Indian company declares dividends in excess of 20% of the paid-up capital, a minimum of 10% of distributable profits will need to be transferred to statutory free reserves (though Companies Act 2013 makes it voluntary for a company to transfer to reserves prior to distribution of profits, this would be applicable once the Act comes in full force).
Amounts transferred to statutory reserves cannot be ploughed 
back into the business of the company. These can be distributed to equity shareholders only on liquidation or in the case of inadequate profits (under the prescribed conditions).
Repatriation of capital
Equity funds can be repatriated only on liquidation or transfer of shares. Limited buy-back provisions are available under corporate laws. Capital reduction can be undertaken in certain circumstances with court approval. Sectors such as defence and construction and development of real estate are subject to a minimum lock-in period before the capital can be repatriated.
External commercial borrowings (ECBs)
Indian companies (other than financial intermediaries) are allowed to raise ECBs from any of the internationally recognised sources such as banks, financial institutions, capital markets, export credit agencies, suppliers of equipment, foreign collaborators and foreign equity holders.
ECBs can be raised from foreign equity holders holding the 
prescribed minimum level of equity in the Indian borrower company:
• ECB up to 5 million USD: Minimum equity of 25% held 
directly by the lender
• ECB more than 5 million USD: Minimum paid up equity of 25% held directly by the lender and an ECB liability-equity ratio not exceeding 4:1 (i.e. the total ECB (existing and proposed) should not exceed four times the direct foreign equity holding). Besides the paid-up capital, free reserves (including share premium received in foreign currency) will also be considered for determining the total equity held by the foreign equity holderECB from an indirect foreign equity holder (holding a minimum 
of 51% equity) or from a group company under a common parent 
has also been permitted under the approval route, provided the 
total ECB liability does not exceed seven times the foreign equity held directly or indirectly by the lender
The prevailing ECB policy stipulates certain specific end-uses for 
ECB proceeds. ECBs can be availed only for the following:
• Import of capital goods, new projects, modernisation and 
expansion. This window can be availed only for projects 
in the real sector - industrial and infrastructure sector and specified services sector
• Import of services, technical know-how and payment of 
license fee as part of import of capital goods by companies  
in manufacturing and infrastructure sector subject to  
certain conditions
• Overseas acquisition by Indian companies
• For all stages of acquisition of shares in the disinvestment 
process under the government’s disinvestment programme 
of the PSU shares; in other words, facility of ECB is available 
for multiple rounds of disinvestment of PSU shares under the Government disinvestment programme
• Companies engaged in the infrastructure sector have been permitted to raise ECB for the payment of interest during construction (being capitalised) and are permitted to import capital goods by availing bridge finance by way of 
the supplier’s or buyer’s credit, subject to certain conditions. 
Also, such companies can utilise 25% of fresh ECB proceeds 
(40% for power sector companies) for the repayment of local rupee borrowings under the approval route subject to the fulfillment of prescribed conditions
• Repayment of rupee loan availed for obtaining a licence or a 
permit for 3G spectrum. This scheme is valid till  
March 31, 2014
• Eligible borrowers can avail ECB under approval route from their foreign equity holder company with minimum average 
maturity of 7 years for general corporate purposes subject 
certain conditions
• Repayment of rupee loan or bridge finance availed by 
successful bidder of 2G Spectrum re-auction
• Consistent foreign exchange earning companies in 
manufacturing infrastructure and the hotel sector (with 
total project cost of 2.5 billion INR or more irrespective of 
the geographical location for hotel sector) can avail ECB for repayment of rupee loan availed for capital expenditure and fresh rupee capital expenditure subject to specified conditions, under the approval route.
• NBFCs exclusively involved in financing infrastructure 
projects i.e. infrastructure finance companies (IFCs) can avail 
ECB up to 75% of their owned funds under automatic route 
and beyond that under approval route, for onlending to the infrastructure sector as defined under the ECB policy and subject to compliance with the norms prescribed in the DNBS Funding Options  
in IndiaChapter 3
12 PwCCircular and hedging requirements as applicable.
• ECB for low cost affordable housing projects has also been 
allowed under approval route and is subject to specified conditions. Low cost affordable housing project is a project in which at least 60% FSI would be for units having maximum carpet area up to 60 square meters. Slum rehabilitation projects also qualify for this scheme based on specified eligibility criteria. 
• Hotels, hospitals and software sector are permitted to avail ECBs under the automatic route. Other service sector units can approach the RBI for permission to raise ECB from foreign equity holders
• ECB has also been allowed for the maintenance and operation of toll systems for roads and highways
• ECB for working capital as a permissible end-use has been allowed for the civil aviation sector under the approval route, subject to the fulfillment of conditions
Apart from the specific end uses mentioned above, ECBs are not permitted for, on-lending or investment in capital market or  real estate.
Pledge of shares
Promoters of an Indian company can pledge their shares to secure a loan obtained under ECB. However, this can happen only if the banker is satisfied that the conditions in the loan agreement are met and the loan registration number is obtained. A non-resident shareholder in an Indian company can also pledge his or her stake in the company in favour of the AD in order to secure a credit facility extended to such a company. The pledge may also be made in favour of an overseas bank to secure credit facilities extended to non-resident promoters or shareholders of the resident Indian company whose shares are pledged, provided, inter alia, such loaned funds are utilised for overseas business purposes. 
Quantum restrictions on ECB
ECB can be availed for incurring rupee or foreign currency expenditure up to the following:
• 750 million USD for borrowers in the infrastructure and 
industrial sectors under the automatic route
• 200 million USD for borrowers in the service sector (hotels, hospitals and software) under the automatic route
• 10 million USD for lending to self-help groups or for micro-credit or for bonafide micro-finance activity including capacity building by NGOs engaged in micro-finance activities
ECBs are required to have the following prescribed minimum average maturities and all¬in-cost ceilings:
The approval requirements for ECBs have been significantly 
liberalised. No prior approvals are required for ECBs complying with the prescribed minimum maturities, ’all-in-cost’ ceilings and end-user requirements. All other ECBs require prior approval from the appropriate RBI committee.
Indian corporate bodies raising ECBs to meet foreign currency expenses can retain the funds abroad until the time of their 
utilisation. Pre-payments up to 500 million USD can be made without approvals, subject to compliance with the minimum average maturity of the loan and in any case three years.
Fully and compulsorily convertible preference shares
Indian companies can mobilise FIs through the issue of fully and compulsorily convertible preference shares. The conversion formula or price needs to be determined upfront. The proposals 
are processed either through the automatic route or the FIPB 
route, as the case may be, depending on the sector in which the Indian company is engaged in. The following guidelines apply:
• Only compulsorily and fully convertible preference shares are 
considered foreign direct equity for the purposes of sectoral 
caps on foreign equity. All other kinds of preference shares, 
optionally convertible or redeemable, fall outside the FDI cap and have to comply with ECB norms
• The dividend rate should not exceed the limit prescribed by the Ministry of Finance, government of India. It is currently fixed at 300 basis points above the State Bank of India’s prime lending rate.
Debentures
Debentures can be issued by Indian companies to raise funds. The debentures can carry an interest coupon rate. Such interest should typically be a tax-deductible expense for the Indian company. Where debentures are issued to a foreign investor, they need to comply with the FDI policy in case of compulsorily convertible debentures (CCDs) and with the ECB guidelines where the debentures are non-convertible or optionally convertible. In case of fully CCDs, conversion formula or price has to be determined upfront.
Global depository receipts (GDRs), American depository receipts (ADRs) and foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs)
Foreign investment through GDRs, ADRs and FCCBs is also treated as FDI. Indian companies are permitted to raise capital in the international market through the issue of GDRs, ADRs and FCCBs, subject to restrictions.
The issue of ADRs or GDRs does not require any prior approval 
(either from the Ministry of Finance, FIPB or the RBI), except where the FDI after such issue will exceed the sectoral caps or policy requirements, in which case prior approval from FIPB is required. There are no end use restrictions on ADRs or GDRs except for a ban on deployment of such funds in real estate or the stock market.
The issue of FCCBs up to  750 million USD also does not require 
prior approval. Only companies listed on the stock exchange are allowed to raise capital through GDRs, ADRs and FCCBs. The end-use of FCCB proceeds has to comply with ECB norms. 
Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     13Foreign currency exchangeable bonds (FCEBs)
In FY 2007-08, the Indian government notified the foreign 
currency exchangeable bonds scheme for the issue of FCEBs. The salient features of the scheme are as follows:
• FCEBs are bonds expressed in foreign currency, the principal 
and interest of which is payable in the same
• An FCEB is issued by a company which is part of the promoter 
group of a listed company whose equity is offered and which is engaged in a sector eligible to receive FDI (offered company) and which holds shares in the offered company. 
The FCEB is subscribed to by a person resident outside India 
and is exchangeable into an equity share of the offered 
company on the basis of any equity related warrants attached to debt instruments
• The investment under the scheme is required to comply with the FDI policy as well as with the ECB policy requirements. The proceeds of FCEB:
 –can be invested in the promoter group companies. Promoter group companies would have to ensure it is 
 –used in accordance with end uses prescribed under the ECB policy
 –not utilised for investments in the capital market or in real estate in India
 –can be invested by the issuing company overseas by way of direct investment (DI), including in a JV or a wholly owned subsidiary (WOS), subject to existing guidelines on Indian DI in a JV or WOS abroad 

14 PwCForeign exchange transactions are regulated under the Foreign 
Exchange Management Act, 1999 (FEMA). Under the FEMA, foreign exchange transactions are divided into two broad categories: current account transactions and capital account transactions. Transactions that alter the assets or liabilities outside India of a person resident in India or, in India, of a person resident outside India, are classified as capital account transactions. All other transactions are considered current account transactions.
The Indian rupee is fully convertible for current account 
transactions, subject to a negative list of transactions which are either prohibited or which require prior approval.
An Indian company with FI is treated equally with other locally 
incorporated companies. Similarly, a foreign-invested Indian company is also treated equally with other locally incorporated companies. Accordingly, the exchange control laws and regulations for residents apply to Indian companies with FI.
Current account transactions
Foreign nationals or Indian citizens who are not permanently residing in India and have been deputed by a foreign company to its office, branch, subsidiary or JV in India are allowed to make recurring remittances abroad for family maintenance of up to 100% of their net salary. Further, up to 100% of the salary of a foreign national or Indian citizen deputed by a foreign company to its Indian office, branch, subsidiary or JV can be paid abroad by the foreign company, subject to the foreign national or Indian citizen paying applicable taxes in India.
Prior approval of the RBI is required for acquiring foreign

Capital account transactions can be undertaken only to the 
extent permitted. The RBI has prescribed a list of capital account transactions, which include the following:
• Investments overseas by residents
• Borrowing or lending in foreign exchange
• Export or import of currency
• Transfer or acquisition of immovable property in or outside 
India liberalised remittance scheme for resident individuals
Under the regulations of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999, resident individuals are permitted to remit up to 75,000 USD per financial year for any permitted current or capital account transaction, or a combination of both, subject to specified terms and conditions under the LRS Scheme in addition to specific limits provided under current account transaction rules. Acquisition of immovable property outside India (directly or indirectly) under LRS scheme would not be allowed. 
In addition to above, the RBI has permitted eligible resident 
individuals to access the LRS window to acquire/set up overseas JV/WOS (which is an operating company) outside India for bona fide business activities by making remittance under the LRS within the limit of USD 75,000 with effect from August 5, 2013. 
In addition, with respect to overseas investments in a joint 
venture, the limit of financial commitment is now 100% of networth of the Indian entity as on the last audited balance sheet date. Investment beyond this cap requires prior permission from Reserve Bank of India.
All other transactions otherwise not permissible under FEMA and 
those in the nature of remittances for margins or margin calls to overseas exchanges or overseas counterparties are not allowed under the scheme.Significant Exchange

However, the benefit will not be available if the holding company is itself a subsidiary of another company.
Tax on buyback of shares
An additional tax is payable on transaction involving the buyback of shares by unlisted companies from its shareholders.

assets such as plant or machinery used earlier in or outside India, any plant or machinery installed in any office premises or in residential accommodation (or guesthouse), any office appliances (including computers or computer software), vehicle, ship or aircraft.   
Taxation of the know-how fee in the hands of foreign companies 
Under domestic tax law, royalties or technical fees payable to non-residents with a permanent establishment in India are taxed on a net basis. In contrast, they are taxed on a gross basis in the case of non-residents without a permanent establishment in the country. The following tax rate apply: 
• W.e.f, 1 April 2013, the applicable rate is 25% for royalty and 
fee for technical services
Surcharge and education cess, as applicable, will also be levied. If the applicable DTAA provides for a rate lower than the above, the same would become applicable.
Taxing dividends received from overseas group companies 
From FY 2011-12, dividends received by Indian companies from specified foreign companies will be taxed at a concessional rate of 15%, this has been further extended to FY 2013-14. However, no expenditure will be deductible while computing this income. ‘Specified foreign company’ refers to the Indian company that holds 26% or more in nominal value of the equity share capital.
18 PwCDouble tax avoidance agreements 
The DTAAs override the provisions of the Indian Income-tax Act 
to the extent that they are more beneficial to the assessee. India has signed DTAAs with 89 countries so far.
Tax residency certificate (TRC)
For obtaining DTAA benefit, it will be necessary for a nonresident assessee to furnish a certificate of it being a resident of that country, obtained by the assessee from the government of that country. The government had earlier prescribed the particulars to be contained in the TRC. However, the requirement of obtaining TRC containing prescribed particulars has been removed with effect from FY 2012-13. Particulars as may be prescribed can be provided separately, through supporting documents. The 2013 Budget has amended the provisions to provide that the TRC produced by a resident of a contracting state will be accepted as his or her residential evidence.
Note:  Concessional tax rates applicable under certain DTAAs that 
India has signed with various countries are provided in under 
Annexure 2.
Tax information exchange agreements (TIEA) 
Since 2011, India has entered into 14 TIEAs, with  Argentina, the Bahamas, Bahrain, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Liberia, Liechtenstein (not yet in force), Macau (China) and Monaco. The objective is to promote international cooperation on tax matters through the exchange of information. These agreements facilitate information-sharing including the exchange of banking and ownership information. However, the nature of tax-related information that can be shared under a TIEA varies from one agreement to another. Besides, 27 other DTAAs so far signed by India also contain standard clauses similar to the operative clauses of a TIEA. These countries are Australia (not yet in force), Chinese Taipei, Colombia (not yet in force), Estonia, Ethiopia, Georgia, Indonesia (not yet in force), Lithuania, Malaysia, Malta (not yet in force),  Mexico, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Netherlands, Norway, Poland (not yet in force), Singapore, Spain (not yet in force), Sweden (not yet in force), Switzerland, Tajikistan, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom (not yet in force), Uruguay (not yet in force), and Uzbekistan (not yet in force). 
Transactions with persons located in  notified territories 
Anti-avoidance measures have been introduced (from 1 June 2011) in order to discourage transactions with those located in countries that do not effectively exchange information with India. These measures enable the Indian government to 
designate any country or jurisdiction not exchanging information 
with India as a ‘notified jurisdictional area’. Transactions between 
any taxpayer and a party located in a notified jurisdictional area will be deemed as transactions between ‘associated enterprises’. Transfer pricing regulations will apply accordingly. Transactions with those located in such jurisdictions will have the following 
additional implications:
• No deduction will be allowed on payments made to any 
financial institution unless an authorisation is issued to the income-tax authorities to seek relevant information from the financial institution
• No deduction will be allowed for any expenditure or 
allowance unless the taxpayer maintains the prescribed 
documents or provides the prescribed information to the  
tax authorities
• Receipts from a person located in the notified jurisdictions, will become taxable income for the taxpayer unless he or she 
is able to explain the source of this money in the hands of the 
payer or in the hands of the beneficial owner.
• Payments made to a person in a notified jurisdictional area 
will be liable for withholding of tax at a higher rate.
Advance rulings 
To facilitate full planning and to avoid future disputes, a non-resident can approach the Authority for Advance Rulings (AAR) to determine aspects of any proposed or current transaction.
An advance ruling can also be sought by a resident to determine 
the tax liability of a non-resident with whom a transaction has been undertaken or is proposed to be undertaken.
Certain notified residents can also apply to the authority to seek 
a ruling concerning the computation of total income.
Such an advance ruling will be binding on the person seeking 
it in relation to the transaction and the income-tax department cannot disregard the ruling unless there is change in the facts or laws affecting it.
General Anti Avoidance Rule (GAAR)
The provisions relating to GAAR were proposed in the 2012 Union Budget. After receiving various representations against the provisions, an expert committee under the chairmanship of Dr Parthasarathi Shome was set up. The 2013 Budget has considered most of this committee’s recommendations and has extended the due date from which the GAAR provisions take effect on 1 April 2016. This means that the GAAR provisions will apply from FY 2015-16. The provisions empower the tax department to declare an ‘arrangement’ entered into by an assessee to be an ‘impermissible avoidance agreement’ (IAA). Consequences of this will be the denial of tax benefit either under the provisions of the Act or under the tax treaty. The provisions can be invoked for any step in or part of any arrangement entered and that arrangement or step may be declared as an IAA. The provisions will attract only the main purpose of the arrangement or step, which is to obtain tax benefit. 
GAAR provisions will not apply in the following cases: 
• Where tax benefit (to all the parties in aggregate) from an 
arrangement in a relevant tax year does not exceed INR 30 million;
• Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) registered with 
Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     19Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and not 
availing any benefit under a Tax Treaty and also investment in FII made by non-resident investor
• Income earned by any person from transfer of investment on or after 1 April 2015 in respect of the investement made by such person before 30 August 2010
Royalty payments
The expression ‘royalty’ is defined as consideration received or 
receivable for transfer of all or any right for certain property or 
information. However, there were the following controversies with regard to meaning, characterisation, scope and taxability  of royalty:
• Whether consideration for use of computer software is  
royalty or not
• Whether the right, property or information has to be used directly by the payer or is to be located in India or control  or possession of it has to be with the payer
• The meaning of the term process, etc.
In order to eliminate the above controversies, the definition of royalty provided under the domestic tax laws has been amended and clarified retrospectively with e effect from  01 June 1976.
It has been clarified that the consideration for use or right to use 
of computer software is ‘royalty’ and that transfer of all or any rights in respect of any right, property or information includes transfer of all or any right for use or right to use a computer software (including granting of a licence) irrespective of the medium through which such a right is transferred.
It has also been clarified that royalty includes consideration for 
any right, property or information, whether or not the following conditions apply:
• The possession or control of such a right, property or 
information is with the payer
• Such a right, property or information is used directly by  the payer
• The location of such a right, property or information is  in India
Further, it has also been clarified that the term ‘process’ includes transmission by satellite (including up-linking, amplification, conversion for down-linking of any signal), cable, optic fibre or by any other similar technology, whether or not such a process is secret.
Meaning not defined under the DTAA or domestic tax law
It has been recently provided that in case any term used in the DTAA is not defined either under it or the domestic tax law and a meaning is assigned to it by issue of a notification by the central government and such a notification is brought into force, then 
the meaning will become applicable to the DTAA from the date 
when it came into force.Tax return by persons holding assets  
outside India
Any resident who is otherwise not required to furnish a return of income, will now be required to furnish a return before the specified due date, if he or she has any asset located outside India including any financial interest in any entity, or is a signing 
authority in any account located outside India.
Wealth tax
Wealth tax is charged on net wealth as on 31 March every 
year (referred to as the valuation date). It is charged both on 
individuals as well as companies at the rate of 1% of the amount 
by which the ‘net wealth’ exceeds  3 million INR. The term ‘net wealth’ broadly represents the excess value of certain assets over the debts concerned. Assets include guest houses and residences, 
motorcars, jewellery, bullion, utensils of gold and silver, yachts, 
boats, aircraft, urban land and cash. A debt is an obligation to 
pay a certain sum of money incurred in relation to any assets that are included in ‘net wealth’.
Direct Taxes Code (DTC)
On 30 August 2010 the government placed before the Parliament the Direct Taxes Code Bill, 2010. It is modelled on the draft Direct Taxes Code (originally released in August 2009), changes proposed in the revised discussion paper (released in June 2010) and further suggestions and comments made by stakeholders.
Note:  The salient features of the 2010 Bill are summarised in 
Annexure 3 .
Gift tax
However, there is no gift tax liability in India. Any sum of 
money exceeding or immovable property whose stamp duty value exceeds or any immovable property whose fair market value exceeds 50,000 INR received without consideration by an individual from any person will be subject to tax as ‘income from other sources’. This will not apply to any sum of money received from the following:
• Relative (spouse, brother, sister, brother or sister of the 
spouse or any lineal ascendants or descendants)
• On the occasion of marriage of the individual
• Under a will or by way of inheritance
• In the death expectation of the donor
Tax incentive schemes
Special economic zone scheme
The SEZ policy was introduced by the government in 2000 to provide an internationally competitive and conducive environment for exports. The SEZ Act, 2005 along with the associated rules, provides the framework for all important legal and regulatory aspects of development as well as for units operating in SEZs.
20 PwCSEZs are duty-free enclaves considered to be outside the 
customs territory of India for the purposes of carrying out their authorised activities.
SEZ developers are entitled to tax holiday in respect of 100% of 
the profits and gains derived from the business of developing the units for any 10 consecutive years out of 15 beginning from the 
year when  the SEZ is notified by the government. Exemption 
to SEZ developers from DDT has been discontinued with effect from 1 June 2011 and MAT exemption to  developers has been discontinued from FY 2011-12. Expenditure undertaken by a developer on account of SEZ development is also exempt from duties of customs, excise and central sales tax.
A unit set up in an approved SEZ enjoys a 100% tax holiday for 
five years and 50% for the next 10 years (in the last five years, subject to certain additional conditions) out of profits derived from actual exports of goods and services. The tax holiday period commences from the year in which the SEZ unit begins to manufacture or produce or provide services.
Note: Annexure 1 describes the salient features and benefits of the 
SEZ.

22 PwCInternational 
assignments in India Chapter 6
There is no tax regime distinct for foreign nationals working in 
India. Taxation of an individual residing in India depends on his or her residential status for the relevant tax year, which in turn depends on the number of days  he or she was physically present in the country. In India, the financial year (that is, the tax year) runs from 1 April of the current year to 31 March of the succeeding year. 
Under the domestic tax law, a person is considered to be a 
resident of India if either of the following conditions is satisfied:
• He or she is present in India for a period of 182 days or more 
in the relevant financial year (also referred to as the ‘182  days rule’)
• He or she is present in India for 60 days during the relevant tax year, and 365 days or more in the preceding four financial years (also referred to as the ‘60 days rule’)
However, in a situation  where a citizen of India leaves the country for the purpose of taking up  employment outside India, or in a case where an Indian citizen or a person of Indian origin, living outside India, comes on a visit to the country, only 182 days rule will  be applicable.
In case an individual satisfies neither of the conditions, he or  
she will then qualify as a non-resident (NR) for that given financial year. 
A resident individual is treated as a resident but not ordinarily 
resident (RNOR) of India, if he or she satisfies any one of the following conditions:
• He or she is a non-resident  in nine out of the 10 years 
preceding the relevant financial year
• He or she is physically present in India for 729 days or less during the seven years preceding the relevant financial year
In case, an individual does not satisfy both the conditions listed above, he or she will then qualify as a resident and  ordinarily resident (ROR) for that specific financial year. 
In determining the physical presence of an individual in India, 
it is not essential that his or her stay in the country   needs to be continuous or at the same place. Further, both, the date of arrival as well as the date of departure are to be considered as days spent in India in order to determine  the duration of stay of the individual in the country. If a foreign individual qualifies as a tax resident of both India as well as his or her home country, the conditions prescribed under the tie-breaker test of the relevant DTAA will have to be referred to in order to determine the tax residential status of the foreign individual. Scope of taxation
Under the domestic tax laws, the scope of taxation for each category of residential status is as follows:
• ROR: Worldwide income of the individual is liable to tax in 
India for the relevant tax year
• RNOR: Income received in India, income accruing or arising from a particular source in India, income derived from a business controlled from India, or income from a profession set up in India is liable to tax in the country
• NR: Income received in India or income accruing or arising from a particular source in India is liable to tax in India
Taxation of employment income
Employment income for services rendered in India is taxable in the country, irrespective of where the income is received.
Taxable income includes all kinds of amounts, received either in 
cash or kind, arising from an office of employment. Apart from income sources such as salaries, fees, bonuses and commissions, some of the most common remuneration items are allowances, reimbursement of personal expenses, education payments and perquisites or benefits provided by the employer, either free of cost or at concessional rates. All such payments are to be included, whether paid directly to the employee or on his or  her behalf.
Housing benefits provided by an employer are generally taxed at 
15% of the salary or the actual rent paid for the accommodation, whichever is less. Hotel accommodation is taxable at 24% of the salary or the actual amount paid, whichever is less. Cost of meals and laundry expenses are fully taxable. The value of any specified security or sweat equity shares allotted or transferred directly or indirectly by the employer or the former employer, free of cost or at a concessional rate, and the amount of any contribution to an approved superannuation fund by the employer, to the extent that it exceeds an amount of 1,00,000 INR, are taxable  as  perquisites in the hands of the employee. Car and driver facilities provided by the employer are also taxable as perquisites at concessional value.
There are a number of issues relating to the taxation of 
employment income, which depends on the facts and circumstances of each case, and on the views taken by the tax authorities. Therefore, it is advisable to seek professional advice on the remuneration package as a whole, in order to minimise Indian tax incidence.
Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     23Tax withholding
With respect to employment income, the employer will be 
required to withhold tax on the earnings from his or her salary at applicable rates and hand over the same to the government’s treasury within seven days from the end of the month during which salary is paid (except for March wherein the timeline is extended up to 30 April of the given financial year). This is applicable even if the employer is not resident in India.
Double taxation agreements
In a situation where an individual is treated as a tax resident of another country, he or she may then qualify for a relief from the Indian tax law under a double taxation agreement signed between the given country and India. Most of the current agreements lay down various tests in order to determine the actual residential status of the individual. Many agreements contain clauses, which exempt a resident of a specific country from tax on employment income incurred within India, if he or she has been residing in the country for less than 183 days within the given tax year, and if other conditions regarding the salary charge back and the  payment of salary by a non-resident, etc  are also satisfied (short stay exemptions). In a situation where the individual is coming from a non-treaty country, a short stay exemption is available under the domestic tax law, provided the individual’s stay in India, during that particular the tax year, does not exceed 90 days and certain other conditions are met.
Tax rates
Taxes are levied at progressive rates in India. Rates applicable for financial year 2013-14 are as follows:
Taxable income over (INR)Not over (INR) Tax in  column 1 (INR)Percentage of tax on excess (%)
0 2,00,000 - 0%
2,00,001 5,00,000 - 10%
5,00,001 10,00,000 30,000 20%
10,00,001 - 1,30,000 30%
Resident senior citizens, aged 60 years or more, earning an income up to 2,50,000 INR do not have to pay any income tax to the country. For senior citizens, aged 80 years and above, the basic exemption limit is 5,00,000 INR.  
A tax credit of up to 2,000 INR is provided to an individual 
earning an income between 200,000 and 500,000 INR. Further, a surcharge of 10% of tax will be levied in a situation where the total income of an individual exceeds 10 million INR. In addition to the above conditions, an education cess   at the rate of 3% of the tax and surcharge (if applicable) will be levied so as to determine the final tax liability.  Tax registration
An individual needs to apply for and obtain his or her tax registration number called the permanent account number (PAN). A PAN is required in order to file the tax returns, and also has to be reported in the tax withholding returns or certificates of the individual.
Tax returns filing
At the end of each financial or tax year, a tax return has to be filed with the income tax authorities in the prescribed format. The due date for filing of return is 31 July of the relevant assessment year. However, a belated return can be filed before 
the expiry of one year from the end of relevant assessment year. 
It is mandatory to file the return electronically if the total income 
exceeds 500,000 INR or where the individual qualifies as a ROR and possesses foreign assets, or has the signing authority for  any of his or her accounts located outside India.
Other matters
Visa
A foreign national coming to India must hold a valid passport and visa. A visa is issued by the Indian consulates or high commissions situated in the respective country, depending upon the purpose and duration of visit. A foreign national is not permitted to take up employment within India, unless he or she holds an employment visa. An employment visa is issued to highly skilled talent or professionals provided that they draw a salary exceeding the prescribed limit. Such a visa is generally issued for a period of one to two years. Extension of the visa can be done in India itself. 
Foreign nationals coming for business meetings or to set up joint 
ventures (JVs) require a business visa. A business visa is cannot be converted into an employment visa within India.
Registration with the foreigners regional  registration officer 
A foreign national visiting India, who either has a valid employment visa or intends to stay for more than 180 days, must register himself or herself within 14 days of arrival into the country with the foreigners regional registration officer (FRRO). On submission of the prescribed documents to the FRRO, a residential permit is thereby issued to the foreign national.
Payment of salaries outside India
The current regulations for exchange control permit a foreign national, who is an employee of a foreign company, and is on secondment or deputation to the office/ branch/ subsidiary/ joint venture in India, to open, hold and maintain a foreign currency account with a bank outside India, and receive his or her entire salary from foreign company for the services rendered in India by credit to bank outside India, provided the tax on the foreign national’s entire salary has been paid in India.
24 PwCSocial security in India
On October 2008, the government introduced its mandatory 
social security norms for foreign nationals, who will qualify to be international workers. A foreign national qualifies to be an international worker, if he or she is coming to India to work for an establishment located within India, to which the Indian social security regulations apply.
An international worker coming from a country, with which India 
has a reciprocal social security agreement (SSA), is exempted from the Indian social security norms in a situation where he or she meets the following criteria:
• He or she is contributing to his or her home country’s social 
security, either as a citizen or resident; and
• He or she enjoys the status of ‘detached worker’ for the  given period, and according to the terms specified in the relevant SSA
Similarly, an international worker from a country with which India has entered into a bilateral comprehensive economic agreement prior to 1 October 2008 is exempted Indian social security where he or she meets the following criteria; 
• He or she is contributing to his or her home country’s social 
security, either as a citizen or resident; and
• The agreement specifically exempts the natural person of the other contracting country from contributing to the social security system in IndiaIndia has, so far, signed SSAs with 17 countries. However, so far, only the SSAs signed with countries such as Belgium, Germany, 
Switzerland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Denmark, Korea, 
France and Hungary, have been notified and made operational. 
Every international worker has to contribute 12% of his or her 
salary, comprising mainly of  basic wages, dearness allowance, 
retaining allowance (but excluding components such as bonus, 
house rent allowance, etc.) to the Employee’s Provident Fund. The employer is required to make a matching contribution (that is, 12% of the salary) and deposit both the employer’s as well as the  employee’s contributions, along with an administrative charge of approximately 1.1% of the salary with the Indian social security authorities by the 20th day of the following month.  Out of the employer’s contribution of 12%, an amount equal to 8.33% of salary is allocated to the pension fund of the international worker. 
An international worker can withdraw the accumulated balance 
of the provident fund under the following circumstances:
• Retirement from service in the establishment or after 
reaching 58 years of age, whichever is later 
• Retirement on account of permanent and total incapacity to work due to bodily or mental infirmity, as certified by a prescribed medical officer or a registered practitioner
• In a situation where he or she is  suffering from certain categories of diseases, detailed in the terms of the scheme
• On ceasing to be an employee of a covered establishment, where the international worker is from an SSA country 
International workers covered under a SSA will be eligible for withdrawal or exportability of pension, as per the provisions of the relevant SSA. However, international workers coming from countries with which India does not have an SSA can withdraw the pension only after rendering services for 10 years with the covered establishments.
For more detailed analysis and further information, please refer 
to our past publications, ‘Assignments in India’ and ‘Indian social security for cross-border assignments’. Foreign nationals who are sent to India on secondment by their foreign employers, for services to be rendered in India, must ensure that a proper secondment structure is already in place. The following considerations need to be kept in mind:
• Place of delivery of the salary
• Charging back the salary to the Indian entity, if is to be paid 
outside India
• Current exchange control regulations for delivering the foreign national’s salary
• Corporate tax implications (permanent  establishment exposure)
• Withholding tax
• Transfer pricing regulations
• Service tax implications

Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     25Indirect Taxation 
in India Chapter 7
Customs duty 
Customs duty is levied by the central government on goods 
imported into and exported from India, though the list of goods on which export duty is levied is limited. The rate of customs duty applicable to a product to be imported or exported depends on its classification under the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 (CTA). 
The customs tariff of India is aligned upto a six-digit level 
with the internationally recognised Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System of tariff nomenclature (HSN) provided by the World Customs Organisation. 
Customs duty is levied on the transaction value of the imported 
or exported goods. While the general principles adopted for the valuation of goods in India are in conformity with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement on customs valuation, the central government has established independent customs valuation rules applicable to the export and import of goods. 
India does not have one uniform element of customs duty, and 
the duty applicable to any product is composed of a number of components. The types of customs duties applicable are as follows:
• Basic customs duty (BCD) is the basic component of customs 
duty levied at the effective rate notified under the First Schedule to the CTA and applied to the landed value of the goods (i.e. the CIF value of the goods plus landing charges  at 1%)
The peak rate of BCD is currently set at 10% for all goods other than agricultural and other specified products. However, the government has the power to exempt specific goods, wholly or in part, from the levy of custom duties. In addition, preferential or concessional rates of duty are available under various bilateral and multilateral trade agreements that India has entered into with other countries
• The countervailing duty (CVD) is equivalent to, and is charged in lieu of, the excise duty applicable on like goods manufactured in India. CVD is calculated on the landed value of goods and the applicable BCD. However, the CVD on specific consumer goods intended for retail sale is calculated on the basis of the maximum retail price (MRP) printed on their packs after allowing specified abatements. The general rate of excise duty is currently 12% and consequently so is the rate of CVD
• Education cess (EC) at 2% and secondary and higher education cess (SHEC) at 1% are also levied on the aggregate customs duties
• Additional duty of customs (ADC) at 4% is charged in addition to the above duties on imports, subject to certain exceptions. ADC is calculated on the aggregate of the assessable value of imported goods, the total customs duties (i.e. BCD and CVD) and the applicable EC and SHEC
BCD, EC and SHEC levied on aggregate customs duties are a cost on any import transaction. The duty incidence arising on account of all other components may be set off or refunded, subject to prescribed conditions. Where goods are imported for the purposes of manufacture, the Indian manufacturer may take credit for the CVD and ADC paid at the time of import to set it off against the output excise duty. In the case of service providers, CVD credit is available to set off against the output service tax. The central government has exempted specific consumer goods imported for retail sale in India, from levy of ADC, subject to the fulfillment of conditions. Similarly, the government allows a refund for the ADC paid on specified goods imported for the purpose of trading in India, subject to the fulfillment of the conditions prescribed under the governing notifications and circulars issued in this regard.

Central value added tax (CENVAT), commonly referred to as excise duty, is a tax levied by the central government on the manufacture or production of movable and marketable goods  in India. 
The rate of excise duty levied on the goods depends on the 
classification of the goods under the excise tariff, which is primarily based on the HSN classification adopted so as to achieve conformity with the customs tariff. The standard rate of excise duty for non-petroleum products is 12%. In addition, Education Cess (EC) at 2% and Secondary and higher education at 1% are applicable on aggregate excise duties. Thus, the effective rate of excise duty is 12.36%. 
The excise duty on most consumer goods intended for retail 
sale is chargeable on the basis of the MRP printed on the goods packaging. However, abatements are admissible at rates ranging from 15 to 55% of the MRP for charging excise duty. Goods other than those covered by an MRP-based assessment are generally chargeable to duty on the transaction value sold to an independent buyer. In addition, the central government has the power to fix tariff values for charging ad valorem duties  on goods. 
The excise duty operates as a pure value added tax (VAT), with 
full set-off of input tax credits in computing and discharging the tax liabilities on the output side. The input tax credit comprises excise duty on indigenously sourced inputs and capital goods, the CVD and ADC portion of customs duty on imported material and service tax on input services, with the exception of certain exclusion that have been provided under CENVAT credit rules in this relation.
There are different product, industry and geographical area 
specific exemptions available under CENVAT, which present excellent business opportunities to manufacturers in India.
Service tax 
The service tax was first introduced in India in the year 1994 with a relatively limited number of services under its ambit. Since then, the list of services has been expanded year on year. In 2012, keeping in with the large number of different service categories and the resultant classification issues, a new concept of service taxation based on a negative list of services was introduced. In this new system of taxation, all services are taxable but for the services mentioned in the negative list.
Generally, it is the service provider who is liable to pay the 
service tax. However, for some specified services, such as transport of goods by road, sponsorship, import of services, etc. 
26 PwCthe obligation to pay service tax rests with the service receiver 
instead. In certain cases, this obligation has been divided between the receiver and the provider in a specified proportion.
The existing rate of service tax is 12%. In addition, EC of 2% 
and SHEC of 1% of the service tax are levied on taxable services. Thus, the effective rate of service tax is 12.36%. 
There is a simple online procedure prescribed for the service 
provider and receiver to register under service tax. The service provider or receiver rendering services from multiple locations within India has been given an option to take either a centralised registration for all locations or opt for separate registration for different locations. Similar to excise duty, service tax is also a pure value added tax. Since both service tax as well as excise duty are federal levies, cross input tax credit has also been allowed. The scheme of input tax credit under service tax has been integrated under CENVAT credit rules and the benefits available to manufacturers have also being extended to the service provider.
The valuation methodology adopted under service tax is  
based on the gross value charged by the service provider. In certain circumstances, the value is derived as per specified valuation rules.
Service tax is a consumption-based tax. The peculiar nature of 
services makes it difficult sometimes to determine the origin and place of consumption of services or the time of completion and rendition of services. This aspect of service taxation in India has progressed tremendously in recent times. Introduction of Point of Taxation Rules, 2011, Place of Provision of Services Rules, 2012 along with the introduction of taxable or non-taxable territory under the negative list based service taxation regime has simplified the process of determination of time and place of rendition and completion of service.
In addition to the negative list of services, there are certain 
services such as education, infrastructure projects like development of roads and bridges, healthcare, sponsorship of sports events, etc which are specifically made exempt from the levy of service tax. There is an abatement scheme for valuation of certain specific service such as transportation, financial leasing, renting, etc and the rate of exemption varies from 10 to 70% of the taxable value. Export of services are completely tax neutral and benefits such as refund of input tax credit and rebate of duty payments are also available.
Sales tax
The sale of movable goods in India is chargeable to tax at the federal or state level. The Indian regulatory framework has granted power to state legislatures to levy tax on goods sold within that state. On the other hand, all goods sold in the course of interstate trade are subject to the federal sales tax i.e. central sales tax (CST).CST is levied at the rate applicable on such goods under the VAT law of the originating state. Where goods are bought and sold by registered dealers for trading or for use as inputs in the manufacture of other goods or specified activities (such as mining or telecommunication networks), the rate of CST would be 2%, provided an appropriate declaration form (Form C in this case) is issued by the purchasing dealer to the selling dealer.
Inter-state procurement on which CST is charged in the 
originating state is not eligible for input tax credit in the destination state.
Value Added Tax
State-level sales tax was replaced by VAT with effect from 1 April, 2005 in most Indian states. At present, all the Indian states have transitioned to the VAT regime.
Under this regime, the VAT paid on goods purchased within 
the state is eligible for VAT credit. The input VAT credit can be utilised against the VAT or CST payable on the sale of goods. This ensures that the cascading effect of taxes is avoided and that only the value addition is taxed. 
Currently, there is no VAT on goods imported into India. Exports 
are zero rated. This means that while exports are not charged to VAT, the purchaser of inputs used in the manufacture of export goods or goods purchased for exports can claim a refund of the VAT charged on the goods. 
In reference to the importance of each commodity with respect to 
the trade of goods in the state, varying tariff rates are assigned to different commodities. General tariff rates prevalent in the state VAT laws could vary from 1% to up to 20%. Apart from this, all those goods which are not covered under any of the tariff rates would be chargeable to the residual rate, which may vary from 12.5 to 15.5%.
Turnover thresholds have been prescribed so as to keep small 
traders out of the ambit of VAT. Small traders can also opt to pay tax under composition scheme, at a lower rate, levied in lieu  of VAT. 
Octroi duty or entry tax 
Entry tax is on entry of specified goods into the state from outside the state for use, consumption or sale therein. Entry tax continues to exist under the VAT regime, though in certain states it has been made Vatable and can be set off against the output VAT liability in the state. 
Entry tax is levied on purchase value, which is defined as the 
amount of the valuable consideration paid or payable by a person for the purchase of any goods. The value of the specified goods can be ascertained from the original invoice for purchase of  such goods. 
Octroi is a municipal tax levied at the time of the entry of 
specified goods into the limits of the municipal corporation. Thus, octroi can be levied if there is movement of goods from one city to another in the same state, in the event the cities fall under the jurisdiction of two different municipal corporations. 
Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     27Goods and services tax (GST)
In 2006, the central government took a major step towards the 
transition to a national integrated GST. Implementation of the GST will be a historical reform in India as it will subsume CVD, excise duties, service tax, CST, state VAT and some other  state levies.
At present, a dual-rate GST model is envisaged whereby the tax 
rate will be converged to one standardised rate of 16% on goods and services within three years of implementation. 
Under the proposed dual GST model, a central GST as well as a 
state GST will be levied on the taxable value of a transaction of supply of goods and services. Both the centre and the state will legislate, levy and administer the central GST and the state  GST, respectively. 
Once implemented, GST will create a single, unified Indian 
market and will diminish the multiple layers of indirect taxation that prevail in India at present. GST is also seen as a reform in administration of indirect taxation and will definitely be favourable for trade. Considering the various issues  pending for discussion between State and Central government, GST is not expected to be roll out before April 2014.
Stamp duty 
Stamp duty is levied at various rates on documents such as bills of exchange, promissory notes, insurance policies, contracts effecting transfer of shares, debentures and conveyances for transfer of immovable property. 
Research and development cess 
Research and redevelopment cess of 5% is levied on all payments 
made for the import of technology. The term ‘technology’ 
includes import of designs, drawings, publications and services 
of technical personnel.
28 PwCMergers & 
Acquisitions Chapter 8
Among the emerging economies, India has witnessed decent 
activity in mergers and acquisitions (M&As) both cross border and domestic, with a remarkable feature of India being on the buyer side quite frequently in recent years. While the boom in the M&A space looks quite far back in the past, the Indian economy maintained a respectable volume of activity in 2012. Indian policymakers tried their best to prop up the M&A space in the economy with liberal tax laws, exchange control regulations and a more transparent environment driven by the objective of protecting the investor at large. 
Part I: Indian M&A framework
The Indian regulatory framework broadly facilitates the acquisition or hive-off through multiple legal modes. While all of them may achieve similar objectives, each one is different from the other on tax outgo parameters as well as the regulatory ease of implementing the deal. The following are the most popular modes of acquisition:
• Share acquisition
• Business acquisition through asset purchase: Assets (itemised 
sale) or business (slump sale)
• Amalgamations and de-mergers
Share acquisition
Implications for the seller
Transfer of shares in Indian companies is taxable as capital gains 
in India, subject to benefits under the applicable DTAA, if any. Furthermore, taxability is dependent on whether the subject shares are listed or unlisted as explained below:
Listed shares• Long-term capital gains (LTCG) i.e. gains resulting from 
shares held for more than 12 months, are exempt from tax if sale is on a recognised stock exchange in India. In case the transaction is carried off the stock exchange, gains are taxed at 10% (without indexation benefits) or 20% (with indexation benefits), whichever is beneficial
• Short-term capital gains (STCG) are taxed at 15%, plus surcharges if sale is on a recognised stock exchange in India. In case the transaction is carried off the stock exchange, it is taxable similar to the unlisted shares
Unlisted shares
• LTCG is taxed at 10% (without indexation benefits) for non-
residents and 20% for residents, plus surcharges
• STCG is taxed at 40% for non-resident companies and 30% for resident companies, plus surcharges
Indian laws have been recently amended to bring under its net the indirect transfer of assets in India through a share or right transfer outside India. Therefore, a share transfer outside the country may be taxable in India, if such a foreign company derives its value substantially from assets located in India or if it results in the transfer of rights in relation to the management or control of an Indian company. Implications for the buyer
• The acquisition of shares of a listed company requires 
compliance with the Takeover Code. An open offer is  required for the acquisition of 25% or more of voting power in a listed company
• The transfer of shares is subject to stamp duty at 0.25% of the value of shares transferred. However, no stamp duty may be payable if such shares are held in an electronic form
• Funding costs in the form of the interest burden on a loan applied for the acquisition of shares may not be tax-deductible as the corresponding dividend income will be exempt from tax in the hands of shareholders
• In case the corporate buyer receives shares of a closely-held company at less than their fair market value (FMV), the difference between the FMV and the sale consideration with respect to such shares is taxable in the hands of the buyer at the applicable corporate tax rate
Withholding tax
• The buyer (including non-residents) is required to withhold 
the applicable taxes resulting from the capital gains in the hands of the non-resident seller. Practically, this requires the buyer to obtain the India tax registration numbers
• No withholding of tax is required in case of acquisition of shares from Indian residents 
Thin capitalisation rules
• Indian companies can be funded by a mix of debt, equity and convertible instruments. There are no prescribed guidelines with respect to the acceptable debt-equity ratios under taxation law
Preservation and  carry-forward of tax losses
• There is no impact on carrying forward of tax losses on 
transfer of shares of a listed company
• Transfer of shares of non-listed companies beyond 49%, shall dis-entitle the company from carrying forward previous years’ business losses
• No impact of transfer of shares on carrying forward unabsorbed depreciation allowance, irrespective of the Indian company’s listing status
Business acquisition through asset purchase 
In the Indian context, businesses can also be acquired through asset purchase. In case of the purchase model, the buyer may cherry-pick assets which he or she prefers and leave the  liabilities in the seller entity itself. As against the asset purchase 
model, businesses can also be acquired through a slump 
sale model wherein the buyer acquires the entire ‘business 
undertaking’ inclusive of related assets and liabilities for a lumpsum consideration. 
Asset purchase model
Implications for the seller
• Computation of gains is done with respect to each asset and 
this is taxable as short-  or long-term capital gains, depending on the period of holding such assets. The sale of depreciable 
Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     29assets always results in short-term capital gains
• Capital gains are determined by reducing the acquisition 
cost of assets from sales consideration. In case of long-term capital gains, the acquisition cost is indexed based on the cost inflation index
• The seller is liable to charge VAT or sales tax on the transfer 
of movable property at specified rates in case of the asset 
purchase model
• The cost of acquisition of self-generated intangible assets such as goodwill will be considered as nil for the purpose of calculating capital gains
• In case the asset purchase model involves the transfer of immovable property, the sale consideration is benchmarked at minimum value determined by stamp taxes authorities, for the limited purpose of calculating capital gains tax
Implications for the buyer
• The buyer is liable for stamp duty on the transfer of 
immovable property at the rate applicable in the  concerned state
• The buyer is also liable for stamp duty on movable property at the applicable rate. However, this is generally minimised through innovations or physical delivery or both
Business transfer model
Implications for the seller
• Capital gains are determined by reducing the net worth of 
business undertaking from sales consideration which shall be determined in a prescribed manner
• Capital gains are taxable as long-term capital gains in case the business undertaking is held for more than three years. No indexation benefit is available in case of slump sale  of undertaking. Taxable at 20% (plus surcharge) if long term else taxable at 30% (plus surcharge) if short term
• Business transfer (also known as Slump sale in India) is typically not subject to VAT or sales tax
Implications for the buyer
• In case of a slump sale, lumpsum purchase consideration is 
allocated to various assets based on a valuation report and hence the purchase of assets such as building, plant and specified intangible assets for use in business is entitled to increased depreciation allowance
• The buyer is liable for stamp duty on the transfer of business undertaking at the rate applicable in the concerned state
Funding costs
Interest on loan taken for the acquisition of assets or business 
undertaking through slump sale is generally tax-deductible, 
subject to certain prescribed rules.
Amalgamations and de-mergers
In some situations the acquired entity can be integrated into the 
buyer group through amalgamation or de-merger. While some variants to the process of amalgamation or de-merger exist, it involves a court process. Such amalgamation or de-merger can be tax neutral for the parties involved subject to achieving certain prescribed conditions. 
Amalgamation (or merger) 
An amalgamation refers to the merger of one or more companies into another through a court process. Conditions to be satisfied to claim tax exemption are as follows:
• All the assets and liabilities of the transferor entity should be 
transferred to the transferee entity
• Shareholders holding at least 75% of shares (in value)  
in transferor company to become shareholders in the 
transferee company
De-mergers
A de-merger refers to the transfer or division of an undertaking 
or a part thereof, from one company into another through a court 
process. Conditions to be satisfied to claim tax exemption are as 
follows:
• All the assets and liabilities of the relevant undertaking of the 
transferor company should be transferred to the  
resulting company
• The transfer of such business undertaking is on a going 
concern basis
• Consideration for a de-merger settled through the issue of shares to the shareholders of the de-merged company should be done on a proportionate basis
• Shareholders holding at least 75% of shares (in value) in a de-merged company are to become shareholders in the resulting company
Carrying forward of accumulated loss and unabsorbed depreciation 
Amalgamation
• Accumulated loss or unabsorbed depreciation of an 
amalgamating company running an industrial undertaking (defined under the law) to be carried forward by the amalgamated company
• Specified conditions laid down like continuance of business, holding of assets, etc.
De-merger
• Accumulated loss or unabsorbed depreciation directly related 
to the undertaking being demerged is transferrable
• Proportionate common losses are also transferable 
Other matters
• Amalgamations and de-mergers normally attract stamp duty at varying rates. Such rates are derived from the laws of the state involved
• Stock exchange, high court and other regulatory clearances 
are required for amalgamations or de-mergers. A more robust 
process has been recently notified for obtaining approval 
from the stock exchanges and theSEBI , which can  be time consuming, especially if  timelines are water tight
30 PwCPart II: Inbound investments
• At the first stage, any investment in India is governed by the 
Indian Exchange Control Regulations which are administered by the RBI. The RBI has issued a Foreign Direct Investment Policy which requires the prior approval from the Ministry of Finance in some cases and also permits the investments in India without any approval subject to certain sectoral and general conditions. Most of the investments in India are permitted without any prior approval of RBI subject to satisfying certain conditions.
• On a broad basis,  Indian policymakers have been encouraging the green field as well as brown field investments in India and there are minimal approval requirements in general sectors. Few sectors like telecom, single or multi brand retail, defence, aerospace and banking may require approvals from respective ministries.
• On a tax front, there are numerous benefits given to any new investment in India. For instance, purchase of additional plant and  machinery has been allowed an increased depreciation allowance. Also, establishing units in special economic zones entails tax holidays for 15 financial years beginning with the year in which the operations commenced.
Part III: Profit and capital repatriation 
Apart from payment towards various services provided by the parent company, funds can also be repatriated through distribution of dividend, repurchase (buy-back) of shares or capital reduction by the Indian company.
Dividend
• It attracts  DDT  of 15% (plus surcharges) and is payable by the company paying the dividend
• In case the dividend is distributed by the subsidiary and such a subsidiary has paid DDT on the dividend declared to its holding company, then such a company is eligible to take the credit of DDT paid by the subsidiary company when distributing dividend to its shareholders
• Dividend is exempt from tax in the hands of shareholders and accordingly, there is no withholding tax on dividend payments on which DDT has been paid by the company
• Companies distributing dividend have to comply with the transfer to reserve rules under the Companies Act and a prescribed minimum depreciation allowance in the books  of accounts
• Since the dividend distribution tax is a unilateral levy on company and hence there remains ambiguity with respect to credit of such taxes in the parent country.
Share buy-back
• A new tax regime has been introduced to tax the share buy-back transactions effected by unlisted companies, effective from 1 June 2013
• Under the new regime, difference between the share buy-back price and the amount received by the company for the corresponding shares, is taxable at the rate of 20% (plus surcharges)• New regime of the share buy-back is taxed, which is also a unilateral levy on company and hence there remains 
ambiguity with respect to credit of such taxes in the  
parent country
Capital reduction
• Requires the approval of the high court
• The amount of distribution on the capital reduction is deemed as a dividend to the extent of accumulated profits of 
the company. The balance distribution, over and above the 
accumulated profits is taxable as capital gains in the hands of the shareholders
• Residuary provisions like withholding of taxes, categorisation 
of capital gains into long term and short term shall equally 
apply here
Part IV: Outbound investments
Regulation of overseas direct investment
• Outbound investment from India to invest in a joint venture 
or a wholly owned subsidiary abroad is allowed under automatic route (except for financial service sector) for bonafide business purposes subject to maximum investment upto 100% of the net worth of the Indian investor
• Presently, the existing regulations do not provide for outbound investments in the partnership firms or any other form of entity other than a company, without prior approval of the RBI
Tax on overseas investments
• Considering the tax regime of target countries coupled  with nascent foreign tax credit regulations, it becomes imperative that investments are structured to optimise overseas tax efficiencies
• Essential tax considerations for the Indian outbound investor are offshore capital gains optimisation, foreign tax reduction and optimisation of the Indian tax credits on repatriation of funds to India
• Dividend received from overseas companies (in which an Indian company holds 26% or more of the equity share capital) is taxable at 15% (plus surcharges) in hands of the Indian company for FY 2013-14 on a gross basis
• Currently, India has not controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules and there is no Indian tax on foreign profits that remain with offshore subsidiaries. The government has proposed to introduce CFC regulations in the proposed DTC , yet to become a law
Outbound structuring
•  It is important to have a robust outbound structure which is flexible, optimises global tax cost, has the ability to bring in new investors and repatriate or deploy funds in a tax  efficient way
Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     31Transfer Pricing 
in IndiaChapter 9
A separate code on transfer pricing (TP) under sections 92 to 92F 
of the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) covers intra-group transactions and is applicable from 1 April 2001. The basic intent of these TP provisions is to avoid the shifting of profits from India to offshore jurisdictions. Since the introduction of the code, transfer pricing has become an important international tax issue affecting multinational enterprises operating in India. Broadly based on the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines, these regulations describe the various transfer pricing methods and impose extensive annual transfer pricing documentation requirements.
Transfer pricing legislation 
The Indian transfer pricing code provides that the price of any international transactions between associated enterprises (AEs) is to be computed with regard to the arm’s length principle. Effective from FY 2012-13, the TP provisions have been extended to specified domestic transactions as well.
However, the TP legislation is not applicable when the 
computation of the arm’s length price (ALP) has the effect of reducing the income chargeable to tax or increase the losses in India. This is aligned with the legislative intent to protect the Indian tax base. 
Transactions covered
The term ‘international transaction’ has been defined to indicate a transaction between two or more AEs involving the sale, purchase or lease of tangible or intangible property, provision of services, cost-sharing arrangements, various modes of capital (debt) financing, guarantees, business re-structuring or re-organisation transactions or any other transaction having a bearing on the profits, income, losses or assets of such enterprises. The AEs can be either two non-residents or a resident and a non-resident. A permanent establishment (PE) of a foreign enterprise also qualifies as an AE. Accordingly, transactions between a foreign enterprise and its Indian PE are within the ambit of the code.
Associated enterprises
The relationship of AEs covers direct and indirect participation in the management, control or capital of an enterprise by another. It also covers situations in which the same person (directly or indirectly) participates in the management, control or capital of both the enterprises.
Based on the following parameters, two enterprises would be 
deemed as AEs:
• A direct or indirect holding of 26% or more voting power 
in an enterprise by the other enterprise or in both the enterprises by the same person
• Advancing of a loan, by an enterprise, that constitutes  51% or more of the total book value of the assets of the borrowing enterprise• Guarantee by an enterprise for 10% or more of total borrowings of the other enterprise
• Appointment by an enterprise of more than 50% of the board of directors or one or more executive directors of the other enterprise or the appointment of specified directorships of both enterprises by the same person
• Dependence of an enterprise (in carrying on its business) on the intellectual property licensed to it by the other enterprise
• Purchase of 90% or more of raw material required by an enterprise from the other enterprise or from any person specified by such other enterprise at prices and conditions influenced by the latter
• Sale of goods or articles manufactured by an enterprise to another enterprise or to a person specified by such other enterprise at prices and conditions influenced by the latter
• Existence of any prescribed relationship of mutual interest (none prescribed till date)
Further, a transaction between an enterprise and a third party may be deemed to be between AEs if there exists a prior agreement in relation to such transaction between the third party and the AE or if the terms of such transactions are determined in substance between the third party and the AE.
Specified domestic transactions (SDT)
From FY 2012-13, the TP provisions have extended their scope to ‘specified domestic transactions’. The following domestic transactions have been specified for this purpose:
• Payment to related parties
3 
• Transactions of tax holiday undertakings with other 
undertakings of the taxpayer4
This provision is applicable only if the aggregate value of such transaction exceeds 50 million INR in the relevant tax year.
Arm’s length principle and pricing methodologies
The following methods have been prescribed for the determination of the ALP:
• Comparable uncontrolled price (CUP) method
• Resale price method (RPM)
• Cost plus method (CPM)
• Profit split method (PSM)
• Transactional net margin method (TNMM)
• Such other methods as may be prescribed
5 
3. Covers expenditure in respect of which payment has been made or to be made to a person referred to in  section 40A(2)(b)
4. Transactions covered in sections 80A, 80-IA(8) and 80-IA(10) and Chapter VI-A and section 10AA of the Act. 5. The CBDT has for FY 2011-12 onwards notified the ‘other method’. It has been d escribed as any method which takes into account the price charged or paid or would 
have been charged or paid for a same or similar uncontrolled transaction, with or bet ween non-AEs, under similar circumstances.
32 PwCNo particular method has been accorded a preference over the 
other. The most appropriate method for a particular transaction will need to be determined according to the nature and class of that transaction or associated persons, and dependent on functions performed by such persons as well as other  relevant factors.
The legislation requires a taxpayer to determine an ALP for 
international transactions. . The Indian legislation does not recognise the concept of arm’s length range but requires the determination of a single ALP, which is computed on the basis of arithmetic mean of comparable prices.
Further the law provides flexibility in ALP by allowing variance of 
around 5% of the transaction value. However for FY 2011-12 the central government has removed 5% and will  notify the variance percentage but for the FY 2012-13 and onwards the variance percentage has been capped at 3%.
Further, the central government has now issued a notification 
FY 2012-13, which specifies the tolerance band to be 1% for wholesale traders and 3% in all other cases. There is however, no clarification provided in the notification as to which taxpayers will  be classified as ‘wholesale traders’. 
It is also to be noted that prior to FY 2009 - 2010, the flexibility 
of 5% was allowed around the ALP and not the transaction value. The law as it stood before FY 2009-2010, resulted in a tax controversy on availability of the benefit of 5% as a standard deduction in computing the ALP. Therefore, the Finance Act 2012 has further clarified that the law had never intended to allow any standard deduction for computing the arm’s length price.
Safe harbour provisions
The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has notified the Safe Harbour (SH) Rules on September 18, 2013. These rules specify the circumstances in which the tax authorities will accept the ALP as declared by a taxpayer, without detailed analysis. The basic intention behind the introduction of these rules is to reduce the tax litigation in determining the transfer prices of international transactions.
The below table provides a snapshot of the SH Rules:However, it is pertinent to note that no comparability 
adjustments are permitted and the benefit of tolerance band (+/- 3 %) is also not available to taxpayers opting for SH provisions. Also a taxpayer opting for Safe Harbour rules would not be entitled to invoke Mutual Agreement Procedure  (MAP) proceedings.
Advance pricing agreements
Recently the provisions relating to advance pricing agreement (APA) has been introduced which are effective from 1 July 2012.
An APA is an agreement between the taxpayer and the tax 
authorities for the upfront determination of the arm’s length price and pricing methodology (which is acceptable to the revenue) of a related party transaction. Essentially, the taxpayers seek an APA to determine the arm’s length price of a transaction upfront, thereby ascertaining their tax liability (from the transaction) and consequently mitigating tax litigation at a  later stage.
The CBDT, with the approval of the central government, has 
been empowered to enter into an APA with any taxpayer, who is undertaking international transactions, to determine the ALP or specify the manner in which ALP shall be determined. The APA so entered shall be binding on the taxpayer and the tax authorities with respect to the transaction covered under the agreement. Such an agreement shall be valid for a period not exceeding five years. The CBDT notified ‘Advance Pricing Agreement Scheme’ (Rules 10F to 10T of Income Tax Rules, 1962) on 30 August 2012 covering detailed rules and procedures (including necessary forms) for application and administration of the APAs.
Documentation and report requirements 
Taxpayers are annually required to maintain a set of extensive information and documents related to international transactions undertaken with AEs. As mentioned above, the transfer pricing provisions are applicable to specified domestic transactions as well. Therefore, the taxpayer is also required to maintain the prescribed documentation in respect of such transaction (effective from FY 2012-13).
Eligible International Transaction Proposed Safe Harbour
Software Development services If annual transaction value is: •	up to INR 5 billion, operating margin of 20% or more,
•	more than INR 5 billion, operating margin of 22% or moreInformation Technology enabled services

Manufacture and export of auto components Core auto-components - operating margin of 12% or moreNon-core auto-components - operating margin of 8.5% or more
Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     33The code prescribes detailed information and documentation 
that the taxpayer has to maintain for demonstrating  that the price complies with the arm’s length principle. All such information or documents should be contemporaneous and in place by the due date for filing the return of income (i.e. 30 November following the close of relevant tax year). The prescribed documents must be maintained for a period of eight years from the end of the relevant tax year and should be updated annually on an ongoing basis.
Taxpayers having aggregate value of international transactions 
below  10 million INR are relieved from maintaining the prescribed documentation. However, even in these cases, it is imperative that documentation is adequate to substantiate the ALP of international transactions.
The documentation requirements are also applicable to the 
foreign companies having income taxable in India.
Accountant’s report
It is mandatory for all taxpayers, to obtain an independent accountant’s report with respect to all international transactions between AEs. The report has to be furnished by the due date of the tax return filing (i.e. on or before 30 November for corporate entities  having international transactions). Effective from FY 2012-13, SDT are also required to be reported in the accountant’s report (under Part C of the recently modified Form 3CEB format) along with the international transactions entered into with the AEs. The accountant’s report from FY 2012-13 and onwards is required to be filed electronically. It requires the accountant to give an opinion on the proper maintenance of prescribed documents and information by the taxpayer. Additionally, the accountant is required to certify the ‘true and correct’ nature of an extensive list of prescribed particulars in Form 3 CEB.Particulars Penalty

Adjustment to taxpayer’s income 100 to 300% of thetotal tax adjustment amount
Failure to furnish accountant’s report 100,000 INRBurden of proof
The burden of proving the arm’s length nature of a transaction primarily lies with the taxpayer. During audit proceedings, if the tax authorities, on the basis of material, information or documents in their possession, are of the opinion that the ALP was not applied to the transaction or the taxpayer did not maintain or produce adequate and correct documents, information, data, the tax officer may readjust or re-compute the price used in the transaction after giving the opportunity of being heard to the tax payer.

Zones in IndiaAnnexure 1
“The objectives of SEZs include making available goods and 
services free of taxes and duties supported by integrated infrastructure for export production, quick approval mechanisms, and a package of incentives to attract foreign and domestic investments for promoting exports.”
Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Government of India
An SEZ is a specifically delineated, duty-free area notified as such by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry under the Special Economic Zones Act, 2005 (SEZ Act). The zone is considered to be outside the customs territory of India for the purposes of carrying out authorised activities. An SEZ is deemed to be a port, ICD, land station and land customs station under the provision of the Customs Act, 1962.
The SEZ Act, 2005 and SEZ Rules, 2006, which came into force 
with effect from 10 February 2006 govern the development of SEZs. The SEZ Act provides the umbrella legal framework for all important legal and regulatory aspects of SEZ development as well as for units operating in these SEZs. An important salient feature of the SEZ Act is that it has an overriding effect over other laws.
The scope of the SEZ Act includes the following:• Establishment of SEZs and units
• Fiscal regime for developers and units
• Requirements, obligations and entitlements
• Single-window clearance mechanism
• Granting of licence to industrial undertakings to be 
established in an SEZ
• Establishment of administrative authority for SEZs set up by the Government of India
• Special courts and single enforcement agency to ensure speedy trials
According to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, SEZs can be set up by private developers, central or state Governments, or jointly by any two or more of the above on contiguous,  vacant land.
Amendments to SEZ Rules,2006
The Department of Commerce amended the SEZ Rules on 18 April 2013 and announced a series of measures in the annual supplement (2013-14) to Foreign Trade Policy 2009-14. Key changes proposed include reduction in minimum land area requirements for multi-product and sector-specific SEZs, doing away with minimum area requirements for IT/ITeS SEZs, graded scale for minimum land area criteria, sector broad-banding, issues on vacancy of land and exit policy for SEZ units.
The SEZ Rules, 2006 (the Rules) were amended very recently, 
on 12 August 2013. The key amendments carried out in the SEZ Rules were:• Expansion of the definition of a ‘sector’ by addition of a provison; 
• Reduction of minimum contiguous land area requirement  by half; 
• Allowing addition of a ‘sector’ to a sector-specific SEZ or a service in a port/ airport subject to higher contiguous land parcel being available; 
• extending duty benefits to cases where additions are proposed to existing non-operational structures; and
• introduction of new Rule 74A permitting transferring ownership of SEZ unit assets subject to a few conditions. 
Fiscal benefits to the developer or co-developer
Income tax incentives
• Hundred per cent tax deduction for 10 years out of 15 years, beginning with the year in which the SEZ is notified by the Government

• Exemption from ADC in lieu of sales tax or VAT on goods 
supplied to an SEZ unit
• Exemption from VAT as per VAT legislation
• Exemption from payment of stamp duty as per state Government policy 
Who should set up an SEZ unit

providers (including IT and ITeS providers, BPOs, contract 
manufacturers, etc.) have huge growth potential in Indian SEZs. 
Electronic hardware, software manufacturers and telecom equipment manufacturers/suppliers can also set up units in SEZs for supply to the domestic market. 
Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     35FDI policy
Hundred per cent FDI is permitted under the automatic route

40 PwCDirect Taxes CodeAnnexure 3
On 12 August 2009, the Indian Government released the draft 
DTC for public debate. The objective is to moderate the tax rates and simplify tax laws. All direct taxes including wealth and income tax will be brought under one code. Public and stakeholder feedback on the proposals outlined in the draft were analysed by the Government, and suggestions for amendments received from public, business associations and other bodies were taken into account. In June 2010, a revised discussion paper addressing the major issues was released and further, feedbacks were received. The DTC Bill, 2010, which addressed the issues and concerns raised by various stakeholders, was tabled in Parliament on 30 August 2010. The Bill was then referred to a Parliamentary Standing Committee of Finance, which prepared a report providing its recommendations after collating the representations made by stakeholders with the response of the Ministry of Finance. The report was released in March 2012. The response of the Ministry and the recommendations of  the Committee provide clarity and are indicative of the  approach that can be expected in the final version of the DTC to be released.
A summary of significant proposals of the DTC follows:
Commencement
The DTC was earlier proposed to be effective from 1 April 2013 
to provide the time to companies to understand the provisions, engage in a dialogue with the Indian Government and, more importantly, restructure their operations as they switch over to taxation under the DTC. Also, this gives time to the Government to adapt its systems to accept and audit additional new compliance requirements imposed on taxpayers.
Tax rates
• Tax rates for individuals as proposed in the DTC Bill 2010 are to be revised as follows:

liable to wealth tax. New categories of assets introduced for 
levying wealth tax are archaeological collections, drawings, paintings, sculptures or any other work of art, watches with a value in excess of INR 50,000 and equity or preference shares 
held in controlled foreign companies (CFC).
International taxation
• Transportation charges paid to a non-resident by a resident 
are taxable as also transportation charges paid by non-residents to non-residents if they are in respect of carriage to or from a place in India
• Income arising from transfer of shares of a foreign company is sought to be taxed in India if assets in India (held directly or indirectly by the company) represent at least 50% of the fair market value of all the assets owned by the foreign company. The 50% test is to be applied at any time during the 12 months prior to the transfer
• The presumptive taxation scheme is continued with no change in the rates except in the case of non-residents engaged in:
 –The business of providing services or supplying plant and machinery in connection with prospecting for or extraction or production of mineral oil or natural gas, wherein the rate will be increased from 10% to 14%;
 –The operation of ships, wherein the rate will be increased from 7.5% to 10%; and

 –Definition of royalty has been expanded and withholding tax rate has been increased from 10% to 20%, both for royalty as well as fees for technical services
 –Head office expenditure would be allowed to the extent of 0.5% of total turnover or gross receipts of business in India
Residency rules
Companies having a place of effective management in India at any time in the year will be considered residents in India.
The place of effective management is defined to mean the 
following:
• A place where board of directors (BoD) or executive directors, 
as the case may be, make their decisions, or
• In a case where the BoD routinely approves commercial and strategic decisions made by the executive directors or officers, the place where such executive directors or officers perform their functions
Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     41• Separately, the CFC provisions are proposed to be introduced 
as an anti-avoidance measure. CFC provisions introduced with a view to tax passive income earned by a foreign company directly or indirectly controlled by a resident  in India
• CFC means a foreign company which satisfy the following 
conditions:
 –The foreign company is controlled by resident taxpayers- 
Control define to mean one or more persons resident in India, individually or collectively, directly or indirectly, hold shares carrying not less than 50% of the voting power or capital of the company
 –Such foreign entity is a resident of a country with a lower level of taxation, i.e. the amount of tax payable in the foreign country is less than 50% of the corresponding tax payable under the DTC
• The net profit earned by the CFC will be attributed (and not only the passive income) to the resident taxpayer based on the percentage holding and for the period such percentages are held
• CFC provisions will not be applicable in case the foreign company is listed on a stock exchange or is engaged in ’active trade or business’ (subject to certain conditions) or if the specified income does not exceed INR 2.5 million

Domestic taxation
Corporate tax
DTC proposes the corporate tax rate to be 30% and also provides for unlimited carry-forward of business losses. In an attempt to rationalise and simplify tax computation, the DTC proposes amendments in the basis of computation of business income from the current ‘business profits with specified adjustments’ to an ‘income-expense model’ prevalent in certain developed and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. Largely, DTC also maintains a status quo on dividend distribution tax (DDT) levy at 15% on the dividend declared or distributed.
Computation
• Business income will be computed based on the income-expense model:
Gross earnings XXXLess: Business expenditure
Operating expenditure (includes all expenditure laid  
out for the purposes of the business)    XXX
Permitted finance charges (includes interest charges,  finance charges, etc.     XXX
Capital allowances (includes depreciation, deferred  revenue expenditure, etc.)     XXX
Taxable income from business    XXX
• Business assets will be distinguished from investment assets. Business assets will be further classified as business trading assets and business capital assets
• 200% weighted deduction for in-house scientific R&D expenditure will be extended to all industries
• The remaining value of the block of business capital assets where all assets cease to exist will continue to be eligible for depreciation
42 PwC• In the case of a finance lease, the lessee would be eligible to 
claim capital allowance
Dividend distribution tax
DDT rate will be maintained at 15%.
Exemptions, deductions and new schemes
• Profit-based tax incentives are sought to be discontinued and 
expenditure or investment-based incentive scheme will be 
introduced and will apply to the following businesses:
 –Generation, transmission or distribution of power
 –Developing or operating and maintaining Infrastructure 
facility (as defined)
 –Operating and maintaining a hospital in specified areas
 –Processing, preservation and packaging of fruits and vegetables
 –Laying and operating cross country natural gas or crude or petroleum, pipeline distribution network including storage 
facilities
 –Setting-up and operating a cold chain facility
 –Setting-up and operating agricultural warehouse facility
 –Building and operating anywhere in India new hotel of two 
star or above category on or after 1 April 2010
 –Building and operating anywhere in India a new hospital with at least 100 beds on or after 1 April 2010
 –Developing and building a housing project under notified schemes of slum redevelopment or rehabilitation commencing on or after 1 April 2010
 –Exploration and production of mineral oil or natural gas
 –Developing a SEZ and to a unit established in a SEZ
Export based incentives or profit-based incentives are proposed to be discontinued without affecting the tax payers currently enjoying such incentives, which will be grandfathered. Tax holiday is proposed for infrastructure companies grandfathered for projects eligible until 31 March 2012. Also a tax holiday for SEZ developers grandfathered for projects notified until 31 March 2012. Tax benefits will be allowed to SEZ units starting operations before 31 March 2014.
Capital Gains
• A paradigm shift in taxation of capital gains is proposed 
under the DTC. All capital gains would be considered as 
income from ordinary sources and be taxable at normal rates 
of tax, removing the benefits of lower rates. However, fair market value substitution date is shifted to 1 April 2000. Cost of acquisition is deemed to be nil for all self-generated assets 
and where cost of assets cannot be determined
• Transfer of business capital assets will be taxed under the 
head business income. STT would continue and no capital gains tax would be levied on the sale of equity shares of a company or unit of an equity oriented fund held for more than one year if STT is paid on the transfer
• Capital gains tax would be payable only on 50% of the gains in case equity shares of a company or unit of an equity oriented fund are held for a period up to one year, if STT is paid on the transfer. The cost of acquisition of assets acquired on retirement from unincorporated body would be prescribed
Mergers and acquisitions
• Full value of consideration in case of transfer of land and 
building has been specified to be the stamp duty value in 
all cases, as against the provisions of the Income-tax Act 
whereby a revenue officer can refer the matter to a valuation officer to determine the value of the land and building
• The Income-tax Act states that exemption on holding 
company to subsidiary transfers shall be withdrawn and the 
exempted gain will be taxed in the year of transfer of original 
asset if the conditions of exemption were violated. The DTC seeks to tax such exempted gain in the year in which the conditions are violated. Hence, the rigours of revising past 
years returns has been done away with
• The DTC narrows the definition of business reorganisation to 
include only reorganisation between ‘residents’
• The DTC specifically provides for the issue of equity shares to shareholders of the demerged company, as against the Income-tax Act which does not specify the nature of shares
• The DTC provides for a liberalised regime for carry forward of loss, as compared to the Income-tax Act
• The DTC provides for carrying forward the losses of the demerged unit upon satisfaction of the business-continuity test. The Income-tax Act does not contain such a condition
• In case of succession of a sole proprietorship, or a partnership firm, by a company, the DTC provides for the carry forward of losses, subject to fulfilment of prescribed conditions. This was not facilitated under the Income-tax Act
• New provisions have been introduced in the DTC which expressly provide for the taxation of income for payments received in case of the retirement of a participant, being a member of an unincorporated body
Slump sale
Profit on slump sale will be liable to tax under the head capital gains.
Individual tax: Residency rules and taxability
The separate category of resident but not ordinarily resident is proposed to be done away with. Resident individuals would enjoy exemption on income sourced outside India for two consecutive financial years i.e. in the financial year in which the individual becomes a resident and in the immediately succeeding financial year if the individual was a non-resident for nine years immediately preceding the financial year in which he or she becomes a resident.
Breaking dawn on the horizon: Destination India 2013     43Financial institutional investors (FIIs)
• Income earned by FIIs would be taxed as capital gains
• Payments made to FIIs as a consideration for sale of listed 
securities shall not be subject to withholding tax
Mutual funds
• Distribution tax of 5% would be levied on distribution of income by an equity-oriented mutual fund. Such income will be exempt in the hands of the investors
• Income distributed by funds other than equity-oriented mutual fund will be taxable in the hands of the investors and shall not be subjected to levy of distribution tax
Banking companies
The deduction for amounts credited to provision for bad and doubtful debts account would be restricted to 1% of aggregate average advances computed in the prescribed manner, subject to fulfilment of prescribed conditions.
Insurance companies
Profits of life insurance business shall be the profits determined in shareholders’ account (subject to certain specified adjustments) and shall be taxable at 30% (as against 12.5% earlier)
• Profits of other insurance business shall be the profits 
disclosed in annual accounts, subject to certain prescribed adjustments
• Insurance or reinsurance premium received by a non-resident entity for covering risk in India shall be taxable at the rate  of 20%
• Tax rate of 5 % has been proposed on the amount of income distributed by a life insurance company to the policyholders of an ‘approved equity oriented life insurance scheme’. This tax seems to be targeted towards ULIP products
Trust taxation
• Trust taxation provisions have been simplified. Differential 
and complex tax regime for determinate and indeterminate 
trusts is proposed to be removed
• Provisions relating to taxation of business income of trust at 
maximum marginal rate have been dropped
Venture capital funds (VCF) and venture capital company (VCC)
• The DTC retains the existing tax regime applicable to VCF and VCC, i.e. only in respect of the investments of VCF or VCC in the venture capital undertaking. The venture capital undertaking is permitted to carry on business in nine specified sectors as well as in any other business as may be prescribed later
• The income of VCF or VCC would be exempt and taxable in the hands of the investor in the VCF or VCC in the manner in which it was received
