Agriculture
With the allocation of INR 1.7 lakh crore towards agriculture, this yearâ€™s budget builds on the long-term vision for the agriculture sector. The sector could get a fillip through the Dhan Dhanya Krishi Yojana for 100 districts, along with crop-specific initiatives on productivity enhancement and crop diversification.
