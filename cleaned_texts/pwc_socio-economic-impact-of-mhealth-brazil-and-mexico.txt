Socio-economic impact  mHealth  assessment report for Brazii and MexicoJune 2o13 Executive summary  Socio-economic impact  mHealth  Overcoming the barriers  adoption  Appendices   PwCThis report was commissioned  the GSMA and put together with inputs from the GSMA Connected Living programme. Socio-economic impact  mHealth  Capturing the socio-economic potentiai  mHealth requires immediate action from regulators and payersExecutive summarySection   their populations age, both Brazii and Mexico are experiencing  need  shift the relative balance  healthcare intervention from acute care  continuous care. However, while the shift  continuous care  happening, there stili remains  significant challenge  these populous emerging markets  provide and sustain universai healthcare. Amidst their infrastructurai, human and financiai limitations, healthcare systems  Brazii and Mexico are struggling  cope. mHealth provides significant advantages that could help these healthcare systems achieve greater impact with the same access  human and financiai resources. According  PwC  analysis,  2o17 the potentiai  mHealth wili  significant: mHealth could enable  additionai .  million people access  the healthcare system  Brazii, and  additionai .  million  the same  Mexico, without having  add  doctor.

Multiple adoption barriers regulatory, economic, structurai and technologicai stand  the way. For this reason the initiai focus for driving adoption rests  policy makers, regulators and payers. The lack   regulatory framework that establishes accountability  various stakeholders, the absence  clearly defined business models and the fragmented and performance- agnostic nature  healthcare systems are some  the barriers that aggravate the reluctance  adopt mHealth created   lack  clear evidence. Since the barriers are systemic, the immediate onus lies  policy makers, regulators and payers  drive and adopt change. Some  the changes that need   brought about include: Policy makers  Brazii and Mexico need  formally integrate mHealth into nationwide healthcare strategy, establishing  regulatory framework that harmonises the regulations between healthcare and mobile services, and removes policy barriers that are currently preventing remote diagnosis and monitoring  patients. Payers must introduce incentives for patients and healthcare providers  adopt mHealth. The regulators and payers should work with the governments and healthcare providers  mandate greater cohesion across the various healthcare providers and reward performance gains from mHealth. Further, policy makers need  support the development and use  mHealth  educating the doctors and patients  the benefits  these solutions and training healthcare providers  these solutions. .  . 812.  . .  . 112.  . o2o.  . o11.  .

Current healthcare challenges  Brazii and Mexico While the economies  Brazii and Mexico progress, the healthcare challenges these countries face are becoming more comparable  those  developed countries. The healthcare systems  Brazii and Mexico, which are undergoing  transition  providing universai healthcare, need  add capabilities that can help them address current and emerging challenges while also more efficiently using limited resources. Mobile technologies that support the delivery  healthcare offer benefits that could  highly relevant  the current needs  these healthcare systems. Universai healthcare systems The healthcare systems  Brazii and Mexico are different  their own right, but face comparable challenges. While private healthcare has significant presence  Brazii and Mexico, both countries aim  provide universai healthcare through public institutions - Sistema Unicare Saude SUS  Brazii and Seguro Popular  Mexico. SUS  leading the transition  universai healthcare  Brazii since 1988, while Seguro Popular was formed  Mexico  2oo3  order  provide universai healthcare  its population. These institutions aim  provide equitable and affordable access  healthcare funded  public resources and which have  specific focus  the population that  usually not covered  any public  private insurance. Lack  resources and access Brazii and Mexico have  considerable gap  physicai and human healthcare resources compared, for example,  OECD countries. This shortage  resources restricts the availability  universai healthcare  only around   the population, leaving  million Brazilians1 and  million Mexicans2 outside the coverage  universai healthcare. Most hospitals are clustered  urban centres, and improving access  healthcare  rurai areas   challenge. The lack  healthcare facilities  rurai  low income areas also creates  inequality  access  healthcare.  Brazii,   patients covered  SUS can  assigned  hospitals within their home area1. But since low income areas have fewer hospitals, residents  these areas are either not assigned  hospitals  experience high waiting times compared  those residents  wealthier areas. .

Guadalupe Aparicio, IMSS Source: The World Bank, PwC analysis:  PwCHigh private spending Lack  adequate access and quality  public healthcare have forced people, especially amongst low income  rurai population,  seek care from private healthcare facilities. This has resulted  high and persistent out--pocket spending  healthcare. Even though both these countries have been making efforts  increase their public spending, its share  stili relatively low compared  other countries, such   the , that have similar universai healthcare systems. The lack  public funding has also been contributing  the high private spending. Changing disease profiles and shift  healthcare needs The profile  diseases  Brazii and Mexico  now much more dominated  chronic diseases than  infectious diseases. Rising urbanisation, culturai diet habits and unhealthy lifestyles have resulted  lower physicai activity levels, which have given rise   growing incidence  chronic diseases. With much lower prevalence rates, infectious  communicable diseases may not pose  big  healthcare burden  the chronic diseases  the future. The healthcare systems  both these countries have historically been designed  provide the acute care needed for infectious diseases. With the rising incidence  chronic diseases, the demand  healthcare systems ili-equipped  deai with these diseases could become unmanageable.   reasonable  expect that the quality  care wili decline, while healthcare costs continue  grow.

Addressing the challenges through mHealth solutions Mobile technologies can connect systems and people, irrespective  their location. Technologies such  mHealth solutions could prove    effective tooi for the healthcare systems  Brazii and Mexico,  they can enhance the quality and reach  care. mHealth solutions could improve clinicai decision-making and coordination within hospitals and across the healthcare system  analysing electronic medicai records.  enabling remote treatment and monitoring, patients can now  treated, staying  home, thus bringing down the cost  care. Doctors time could thus  better allocated and beds  hospitals can  made available for other patients. The enhanced reach provided  mHealth could even extend the access  care  rurai and low income people. Assessing socio-economic impact mHealth could make healthcare delivery fairer  lowering the cost  care and increasing access. Fewer hospitalisations, healthier lives and  more productive healthcare delivery system could enable  improved economic output,  enhanced quality  life and  increased efficiency  healthcare spend. Therefore, mHealth has the potentiai  create  significant socio-economic impact  enhancing healthcare delivery across the following four dimensions: Stronger healthcare systems: Enhancing clinicai decision- making and improving utilisation  physicai and human healthcare resources  integrating systems, equipping staff with latest information and enabling reai-time and easier  see analysis  health patterns  patients.

While  have referenced these inputs throughout the report, the methodology and assumptions for quantifying the impact have been detailed  the appendices. . . . Making healthcare systems efficient Inefficient utilisation  information technology and electronic health records The lack   integrated health system and the insufficient use  electronic health records exposes the inefficiencies  Mexico  and Brazii  healthcare systems. The inefficiencies also hamper -hospitai administration through the lack  referrals across different levels  care and limited coordination amongst different departments within  hospitai. Further, practitioners spend     their time gathering and analysing medicai and patient care data. Thus, the limited presence  electronic medicai records also increases manuai effort and administrative costs. Healthcare  solutions  these countries, today,  not provide many practitioners with enough information updates  the latest protocols and best practices internationally. Resulting lack  ready availability  information leads  uninformed clinicai decisions such  prescription and procedurai errors related  medication.

Due  these lifestyle disorders,  least .  million are  significant risk  developing chronic diseases such  T2DM, COPD and CVD.   estimated that due  the growing risk  chronic diseases, the totai number  patients suffering from these diseases  Brazii and Mexico can rise from  least  million  2o12   least  million  2o17. Besides increasing the risk  chronic disease, unhealthy lifestyles can increase their severity  escalating the chances  developing complications, which could aggravate the healthcare and economic burden these diseases pose. Therefore, improving lifestyles  limit the incidence  these chronic diseases and reduce their severity  criticai. Importance  wellness and prevention and challenges  encouraging  Wellness measures can effectively help manage lifestyles which wili not only overcome disorders such  obesity but also limit the risk  developing chronic diseases. However, educating patients  the importance  wellness and preventive care and motivating them  improve their lifestyles  challenging. The culturai acceptance  obesity  Mexico reflects  the fact that about   their totai population  either overweight  obese. Whilst  Brazii, around   the men  urban centers  Brazii are overweight which demonstrates  lack  awareness  the risks that lifestyle disorders pose. Lack  awareness also extends  maternai and child care. Brazii and Mexico have made significant efforts  educate expecting mothers  ways  manage pregnancy and child birth better, but despite that    expecting mothers  not comply with the schedule for doctor visits, elevating the risk  pre-term and stili births. Furthermore, the lack  healthcare resource poses  challenge  spreading health awareness  Brazii and Mexico. For example,  Brazii, the family healthcare teams deployed  SUS  promote good health and provide care cover only   the population1o. The limited healthcare resources need   equipped with tools that can allow them  efficiently reach more people   greater frequency  order  overcome the culturai barriers that limit health awareness, which could  turn make the awareness initiatives more effective.

Having established the connection, healthcare providers could work with service providers such  telecom operators  provide information that convinces patients  use educationai mHealth services. Using these services, patients could receive generai and personalised health tips through short message service SMS, calls and emails, which make them more aware  the importance  healthy lifestyles and preventive measures. Even with increased awareness, the lack  self-motivation and adherence  wellness regimes may continue  inhibit patients from managing their lifestyles better. mHealth can play  key role  motivating patients  sustain lifestyle improvement initiatives through interactive solutions that encourage  game- like attitude  attaining wellness goals. Patients can use these solutions  manage information about diet, exercise regimes and medication. The resulting reports and trends can  put  web- based communities and patients can  rewarded for achieving their fitness objectives. Furthermore, doctors could use these reports and trends  customise healthcare and thereby increase its effectiveness. Hence, healthcare providers could use mHealth  empower patients  improve their lifestyles, avoid diseases and reduce their severity.

The four key barriers  adoption Multiple stakeholders involved  the delivery  healthcare, including public healthcare providers and private insurance companies, are already making efforts  deploy mHealth  Brazii and Mexico but mHealth has not yet reached scale. The overali socio-economic impact  promising but there are four sets  active barriers that are limiting its adoption: Regulatory: There   need for clear regulation  area  mHealth. The absence  regulation  some fundamentai areas  slowing the adoption  mHealth. Some  the challenges created due  the absence  regulation are  follows: Current regulation restricts the practice  medicine  facility-based protocols only.  doctor cannot diagnose, treat  prescribe outside  healthcare facility. Even  simple phone cali from the doctor  home  the patient  illegai, creating significant limitations for mHealth. Technologicai standards need   established and interoperability promoted  enable scale and ease  use  innovation  mHealth product development. Clarity needs   provided  how medicai device regulations apply  mHealth, providing  clear pathway for certification, while ensuring patient safety and trust. Economic: Currently, economic incentives that could facilitate the commercialisation  mHealth and efficient realisation  its benefits are not available. Some  the constraints are  follows: The evidence base  mHealth benefits needs   strengthened  easily convince healthcare providers and regulators  the value mHealth can create. Performance and financiai incentives that encourage healthcare providers  focus  transactions rather than quality  clinicai outcomes prevent them from considering  evaluating technologies such  mHealth which can shift care outside  hospitals. Lack  insurance coverage  reimbursement mechanisms for the use  mHealth makes mHealth solutions and devices unaffordable for patients, especially  the low- income groups. Limited healthcare budgets can restrict public investments  research and development  mHealth solutions, creating  burden for the private sector.  lack  awareness  the benefits  mHealth amongst healthcare providers keeps them from encouraging patients  use mHealth solutions. Furthermore, this lack  awareness creates  reluctance  invest  addressing the change management needs associated with deployment  mHealth.

Hospitals today  not share electronic medicai records among their departments, much less between enterprises. Even  the most sophisticated hospitals, the emergency room and clinicai records are not integrated into the hospitai records. Since there   incentive for hospitals  exchange data, government intervention and policy setting wili  required. This poses  risk  localisation  mHealth systems and can keep mHealth from scaling .  have seen good indications from MOH  DATASUS regarding the agency plans for health information exchanges which  encouraging, but these must  combined with regulatory policies  encourage commitment from hospitals  embrace the data exchange requirements. Furthermore, absence  performance-based incentives for public healthcare providers limits their competitiveness, which could restrict their need  leverage mHealth  making their resources more efficient. Technologicai: Even though telecom networks exist and sufficient mobile coverage  present, the lack  interoperability  solutions and devices and common data standards prevent mHealth solutions from achieving scale. However, these barriers are relatively easy  address provided there   sufficient support  healthcare regulators and the relevant telecommunications regulators  promote adoption  mHealth solutions amongst healthcare solution providers. Cali for immediate action Many mHealth benefits are system oriented and may  visible over the longer term.  ensure that these benefits can  attained  the longer term, the four main areas such  regulatory, economic, structurai and technologicai, need   acted upon immediately.
