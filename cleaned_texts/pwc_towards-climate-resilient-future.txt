Towards  climate -resilient future: Strategies for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands March 2o25 PwC  Foreword The Andaman and Nicobar Islands ANI stand  the frontlines  climate change, where the impact  both immediate and significant. This unique region faces  myriad  challenges rising sea levels, changing weather patterns, increasing temperatures and biodiversity threats affecting the environment  weli  the lives  the people  these regions. Over the past few years, PwC India Foundation PwCIF has actively supported development efforts  the ANI, working closely with locai communities, government bodies and think tanks  foster sustainable solutions and improve quality  life.  our lates  study,  collaboration between PwC India and PwCIF,  have conducted extensive research and engaged with stakeholders  identify the socio -economic, biophysicai and climate- related challenges  these islands. Tailored  the adaptation and mitigation needs  the ANI,  have prepared  comprehensive climate -resilient action plan comprising viable climate solutions and financing options.  extend our gratitude  the many individuals whose invaluable insights have shaped this report. Their contribution has been cruciai  understanding the complex dynamics  play and enabled   curate effective solutions.   move forward, our focus wili   implementing these solutions.  remain committed  this mission, dedicated  making  measurable impact  the ground.  hope that this report wili serve   guiding document for policymakers, businesses and communities  the ANI, catalysing meaningfui change towards  sustainabi  future.

Recent government initiatives have aimed  transform the ANI into  economic hub, focusing  infrastructure, trade, commerce and tourism. However, given the islands ecologicai sensitivity and vulnerability  climate change,  climate -resilient development approach  essentiai. This report, jointly developed  PwC India and the PwCIF, presents  comprehensive climate- resilient action plan that outlines viable climate solutions along with financing options for implementation  the most vulnerable regions  the ANI. The report  divided into six chapters, which are summarised below: Chapter : Setting the context This chapter establishes the context  the study against the background  ongoing and planned development activities  the ANI, along with the ecologicai, climatic and sociai vulnerabilities  the islands.  also introduces the conceptuai framework used  formulate the action plan, which  the IPCC  Climate -Resilient Development Framework from AR6. The action plan  derived from the identified needs  the ANI with the aim  fostering broader adaptation and mitigation benefits. Chapter : Situationai analysis This chapter provides  comprehensive overview  the ANI  geographic, ecologicai and socio -economic profile, identifying key challenges and vulnerabilities.  LULC assessment was conducted  analyse changes  land use land cover patterns  the ANI   the past two decades. The analysis indicated that the ANI has experienced  increase  agriculturai activities, particularly plantations orchards and annuai crops, while traditionai kharif cropping has declined. Evergreen and semi-evergreen woodlands have decreased, with  corresponding increase  degraded woodlands. Moreover, there has been  reduction  littorai, swamp mangroves and  increase  the minimum spread  water bodies. The overali landscape has shifted towards more intensive land use, with significant changes  agriculturai practices and forest cover.  addition  the LULC assessment,  climate change impact assessment was conducted using geospatiai analysis  climate indicators such  temperature, precipitation, sea levei rise and extreme weather events. The results indicated that the ANI  coastai, marine and forest ecosystems have been adversely affected  climate change. These impacts are manifested  various ways, such  degradation  soii quality, increased soii erosion, altered water availability, shifts  salinity distribution and nutrient leaching. These environmentai changes lead  cascading physicai, sociai and ecologicai repercussions that further degrade the ANI  naturai ecosystems. Chapter : Identifying solutions for addressing vulnerabilities This chapter outlines measures  enhance the resilience  locai communities and mitigation measures  reduce and sequester carbon emissions.  CVI was developed using bio -physicai, socio- economic and demographic factors  identify the most vulnerable regions  the ANI. Diglipur, Mayabunder and Ferrargunj emerged  the most vulnerable sub- districts. Subsequently, the viability  severai solutions  address the specific vulnerabilities  these sub -districts were assessed. Agroforestry, clean cookstov , decentralised renewable energy, coconut husk biochar and mangrove conservation emerged  the most viable options that could  developed into pilot projects for implementation. Tow ards  climate -resilient future: Strategies for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands March 2o25 PwC  Chapter : Green finance options This chapter examines the financiai mechanisms  support the implementation  the climate solutions identified  the previous chapter. Green finance options, including impact investment, green bonds, green loans, climate finance and carbon markets, were evaluated based  key parameters such  accessibility, regulatory flexibility, volatility, returns and scalability. Among these options, carbon markets emerged  the most viable choice for financing the climate solutions  Diglipur, Mayabunder and Fer rargunj. Chapter : Feasibility  carbon markets for pilot intervention This chapter shortlists two  three climate solutions from those identified  Chapter  based  their feasibility for implementation through carbon market financing. The assessment considered factors such  the degree  alignment with existing carbon methodologies . . Verra and Gold Standard, estimated emission reductions, indicative price credit, and additionality through alignment with the SDGs. Mangrove restoration, clean cookstoves and decentralised renewable energy emerged  the most promising solutions, with mangrove restoration standing out due  its significant carbon sequestration potentiai and additionai - benefits.  one  the three main blue carbon ecosystems  the ANI, mangroves present  untapped opportunity for the region, which have largely remained unexplored. Chapter : The way forward This chapter summarises the key findings  the report. Mangrove restoration, clean cookstoves and decentralised renewable energy were identified  the measures best suited for implementing  pilots  Diglipur, Mayabunder and Ferrargunj, with carbon mar kets  the preferred financing mechanism. The next phase  the project wili focus  implementing these measures  the identified areas. Key upcoming activities include developing detailed project plans for the pilots, securing funding and executing them  the ground.

For instance, people  the ANI are increasingly vulnerable  climate cha nge-induced diseases such  malaria and dengue,  their prevalence  expected  increase with rising temperatures. This risk  further increased  limited healthcare facilities  the islands. Within this context  geopoliticai and ecologicai significance and the growing threats posed  climate change,  balanced approach towards sustainable development  essentiai. This approach must incorporate climate - resilient strategies that protect and preserve the fragile ecosystem while addressing the region  economic and strategic needs. This study has been conducted within this framewo  with the aim  developing climate - resilient solutions that support sustainable development  the ANI. . . About the study Objective and conceptuai underpinning This study uses the lens  the IPCC CRD framework, with the aim  identifying solutions for the ANI that wili build climate resilience and achieve sustainable development outcomes. CRD  defined   process  implementing greenhouse gas mitigation   adaptation options  support sustainable development for ali  ways that support human and planetary health and weli -being, equity and justice.  According  the CRD framework, climate action adaptation and mitigation and sustainable development are interlinked and cannot  effectively achieved  isolation. Adaptation actions enhance sociai, economic and ecologicai resilience  climate change, thereby supporting sustainable development outcomes.
