Investors are also more likely  consider taking development risk. Large institutionai players, for example, are now breaking with tradition  partnering with big devei - opers  China  build core assets. Reai estate capitai flows  Asia remained robust  2o13, despite dislocations  regionai portfolio flows caused  the threat   tapering  . . economic stimulus. While bond and equity prices including reai estate investment trust REIT markets have therefore dropped significantly from recent peaks, the physicai market for reai estate has  far been largely unaffected. One reason for this  the increase  sovereign wealth and institutionai capitai now aimed  Asian markets. Another  that Asian capitai has become increasingly dominant  the post globai financiai crisis environment, especially given the substantiai volumes  capitai being exported from individuai Asian countries  particular China, South Korea, and Singapore into reai estate assets across the region. This can  expected  continue  2o14. One  the biggest recipients  these and also  globai flows  Japan, where the government has begun  massive monetary stimulus program aimed  jump-starting inflation  the economy.  addition, major reai estate markets  the West are for the first time attracting large flows  Asian capitai  ali types sovereign wealth, institutionai, insurance company, and private money  now flooding westward  unprecedented volumes.

China and India, however, bank credit remains tight.  the capitai markets side, equities have been hit  the threat  the tapering,  foreign funds are repatriated, but the bond markets have seesawed throughout the year the market window remained open  the end  2o13, although this may prove  last hur - rah.

The comments  one fund manager about distress  Australia are probably just  applicable elsewhere: Commerce begets commerce the more deals you   the distress side, the more people come  you and say,   finally looking  move these bad posi - tions.  the big portfolio plays may now  much harder  come , but  continue  see  lot  flow deals  the dis - tress  value side, often single assets that are undermanaged  underleased.   not like you  buying them  absolute bar - gain basement, but you  getting them   devalued price. What this implies  that distress  the Asian context does not necessarily involve picking over bankrupt projects.  one Emerging Trends  Reai Estate Asia Pacific 2o14investor said  reference  China and India, Usually, what distress means  not  much  bank selling NPLs nonper - forming loans, but more  developer   liquidity squeeze.  you  not going  buy  asset screamingly cheap, but you  going   able  negotiate good--acceptable terms  some sort  structured financing  recapitalization. Among particular types  opportunities, residentiai land for mass-planned projects  Australia, smali cash-challenged developers  China senior-secured deals     percent internai rates  return IRRs, smali overseas developers  luxury residentiai properties  Singapore, and even bank - rupted development deals  Vietnam were ali mentioned  interviewees  offering potentiai for distress  2o14. India: Progress  Paralysis? The market most likely  yield potentiai distress  defined above, however,  India, where  lot  arm-waving  going  after  string  recent calamities. Government policy conflicts, slowing economic growth, falling foreign direct investment FDI, and rising inflation and borrowing costs have had  significant impact  the domestic reai estate sector, with many developers now suffering serious funding gaps. The problems have been compounded    percent coi - lapse  the value  the rupee  mid-2o13 since retraced  about  percent.  pervasive sense  nervousness  India has led the business sector  hoard its cash.  addition, according  one Indian consultant, locai banks are refusing  lend for speculative commerciai developments with some exceptions, such   parks and otherwise charge    percent for financing. The resulting funding gap has created demand from developers for senior-secured debt, the play currently favored  India  nonbanking financiai companies NBFCs, the market  dominant domestic financiers. Although senior- secured IRRs had come down  around  percent  mid- 2o13, foreign investors have now raised their asking price     percent after the currency collapse. The question with India  the extent  which these opportunities wili  attractive   somewhat cynicai foreign investment community. Despite its undoubted potentiai, the Indian market  plagued   combination  politicai, regulatory, currency, and market risk that has prompted many foreign funds  remain  the sidelines for severai years.

That apart,  the Indian government allows FDI  REITs,  wili also offer  glimmer  hope for  shift   more open environment generally for FDI flows:  principle, the fact that you  going  allow REITs  invest  smaller properties, income-producing assets, means that ali the guidelines India has that restrict foreign capitai flows into income-producing assets would  vulnerable, because not only would foreign investors then  able  put money into those assets, the quantum they could place would   low  2oo, ooo rupees about  , 2oo.  addition, severai other land investment oriented bills  reforms are  the pipeline  have recently been passed. There  even talk  reforms  the FDI reai estate guide - lines. India has experienced false dawns  the regulatory front before, but there seems    greater recognition now that the former protective and dysfunctionai regime was ultimately counterproductive.  one India-based consultant commented, There   lot  politicai motivation, which  essentially the reason  think some  these things have been rolled out the bigger picture  that India seems keen  creating  more regulated, more transparent, and more forth - coming regulatory framework for attracting investment both from foreign and Indian sources into reai estate assets. Lower Your Returns, but Underwrite Compression  opportunistic returns   percent plus are considered unattainable, one obvious solution   lower the targeted return and make  the difference through increased capitai values. And that  what some buyers are doing.  one Japanese-based investor said, The straight distress, opportunistic deals they  just not here.  now, for some  these guys,  percent  considered the new . Investors wili take what may actually   core-plus deai, increase the leverage, make the asset more efficient, and hope that cap rates compress. While that compression may not officially  part  the calculation, there  certainly  expectation   underlying the logic  the purchase.  one fund manager described ,   really  engineer - ing-type play with the hope that something  going     the future. The idea, basically,   get some money out, hope the market recovers, and worst case they  end  with  good single-digit return, which isn   bad thing. Another investor commented,  you buy   , but you think you can move  today   . , and you think ultimately you can move    . .  yes, that  compression from   . , but   not like you  penciling  15o basis points  cap rate compres - sion.   just that   very believable. Although plenty  investors  the Japanese -grade office space are playing this strategy,  significant minority voiced skepticism. While  paper, for example, office vacan - cies have declined and rents have shown signs  stabilizing, some question whether this   result  discounts and incen - tives offered  landlords.   been catching  falling knife for three years, said one. Another said that office  stili ques - tionable because  the supply pipeline. Apart from Japan, the cap rate compression thesis seems strongest  two other markets: India, where reai estate funda - mentals remain fairly resilient and there   expectation that the government over the medium term wili  able  over - come  wave  negativity over the economy; and Australia, which has seen two base-rate cuts  2o13 that have reduced the risk-free . . , sovereign bond rate and widened yield spreads  core assets  around 4oo basis points. Lengthening Investment Horizons Another way  which the trend toward lower opportunistic returns has been expressed   opting for longer investment windows. One interviewee spoke  buying high-quality assets  first-tier Chinese  Indian cities with relatively low leverage say,    percent instead     percent  order  protect the deai from market fluctuations. That translates    and   not one you  going  flip,   really geared more  holding ten   years.  you end  getting     percent IRR, but   very attractive multiple.   say that does characterize the type  opportunistic investor that   the ----the-new--and- -playing-for-multiple category. That said, this lower return higher multiple approach  not necessarily widespread, not least because many fund managers are confident they can stili deliver the higher return. For ,   the new ,  one investor put .   say for some styles  investing that probably  the reality, and   much more the -big portfolio-building strategy.

Longer holding periods are also  reflection  maturing investment strategies  markets that traditionally have been focused  flipping assets for  fast buck,  where develop - ers have had little choice but  turn their inventory  soon  possible because they otherwise lacked capitai  invest Emerging Trends  Reai Estate Asia Pacific 2o14in their next deai.  one foreign developer active  China said, There are locai developers today who are becoming what they cali huggers  instead  selling strata, they now want  hold buildings for  longer period and probably inject into some kind  equity,  inject  into  potentiai REIT  the future.  you could see some  these developers beginning  hug   their group commerciai buildings   beginning now. Speculation  Back The type  highly structured deai  much the hallmark  the days before the globai financiai crisis might now seem  thing  the past, but  pressure mounts  investors  some markets both  source deals and  make the numbers add ,  sense  déjà   creeping . Japan  particular  the target   large volume  recently raised foreign capitai that must now compete against cashed- locai investors with very low expectations  returns.  one fund manager said, There  too much money, too much liquidity  certain mar - kets,  you have overweight capitai that can  find deals. Yet, foreign funds stili place money simply because they have  deploy  Abenomics has renewed that speculator mentality. Loan--value LTV ratios have inched  across Asia over the last year. They now commonly register    per- cent across Asian markets and can reach    percent  Japan, depending  ticket size and asset type.  fact,  few deals  Japan have been struck  2o13 with leverage  high   percent plus.  one investor said, Some  them have been generated  European banks unwilling  unable  take writedowns  deals they did back  2oo6 2oo7.  they bring   new sponsor and restructure  they don  have  take  writedown. They basically give the equity guys  option, effectively    percent,  the hope the market recovers. While these deals have made sellers look like heroes for holding , the issue for buyers  not only that they are highly levered, but also that they are conceived   basis that implies significant cap rate compression  order  reach the projected opportunistic return.  one investor put , Basically,   just  punt.   fair, these highly structured, seller-financed deals are exceptionai.  one fund manager observed, The taste for most private equity players   that with big positions , perhaps, not  thing  the past, but there  much less appe - tite for . Stili, the fact they are happening  ali has raised eyebrows. One fund manager commenting about Tokyo said,  heard someone saying they  bought  residentiai portfolio leveraged  , and with yield and cost  debt where they are,   clearly irresistible for some opportunistic funds just  get those returns through leverage  suspect that wili continue, but    risky strategy.  China, speculative plays based  the assumption  ongoing price increases have long been common among locai buyers, and are now increasingly  among foreigners, too.  one foreign investor tells , Some  the trades  Shanghai and Beijing are fully let office buildings trading   percent net effective yields, although they say    percent gross.  those are such great deals, and now the market has opened  for the insurance companies and ali they have    achieve    percent yield, why would core investors  China  buying these assets?  were shown  building last year, and  had  laugh  the broker.  said, Wait  minute,  only nets  .  percent yield.

Niche sectors not only produce higher returns, but also tend  require  certain degree  specialization, which,  turn, winnows out the investors willing  qualified  compete.   result, interviewees this year regularly cited their interest  various types  niche play,  particular  Japan, where competition for assets  intense and where alternatives are especially attractive: Japanese domestic capitai  very risk-averse, and   can play  some  those areas where they don  feei comfortable, that can offer some attractive opportunities. Logistics The industriai distribution sector featured strongly  last year  Emerging Trends  Reai Estate Asia Pacific report. Its popularity has continued into 2o14, with the sector again registering the strongest sentiment among the various invest - ment categories  survey responses. The bullish sentiment  confirmed  recent statistics, with transactions   .  billion  Asian industriai and logistics assets reported  the third quarter  2o13, according  CBRE,   percent year  year. Existing logistics facilities throughout Asia are, for the most part, fairly basic  nature and  short supply.   result, and  distribution strategies  both internationai and domestic manufacturers become more sophisticated, there  growing demand for facilities able  offer more complex ser - vices and that cater  the needs  third-party logistics 3PL providers, who have now become the major driver  demand for new logistics facilities regionally.  addition,  internet sales  the region take off particularly  China, demand  growing for new inward-focused infrastructure  serve domestic consumer demand,  opposed  first-generation facilities that were oriented toward exporting from Asian ports  the developed world.   result, logistics has become one  the most sought-after sectors for reai estate investors  ali markets  they continue  seek higher yields. Investors must consider various issues, however. First, there   huge amount  competition because  many people are eyeing the same play and because construction costs are low. This also means that placing large amounts  money can  problematic. Second, because  can take you  year-and--half  tie down the signing and get ali the permitting  place, the ideai modei   line  tenants beforehand. For this reason, logistics  often the preserve  larger, specialist players that can preseli facilities  their exist - ing clients. Otherwise you buy , build , and  just sits there. Referring  China, one investor said, Development yields for logistics are much higher than those for other property sectors within  much shorter development cycle cali   months. , from  risk-adjusted standpoint,  offers  pretty compelling proposition: mid--high teens over  eight--ten- year period.

Senior Care Senior living was another popular interview theme  result  the universai shortage  existing product and  demo - graphic trend throughout Asia Japan  particular toward longer life spans. Senior care facilities are tricky  Asia, however, for  number  reasons. First, differing culturai expectations   EXHIBIT - Prime Yields  Sector,  2o13 Source: CBRE Research.

Asia must therefore find its own models. Investors must try  figure out, for example, how  whole generation  Chinese   certain sociai stratum  going  behave. Are they going  buy  retirement home the way their counterparts did  the . .  years ago? Probably not, said one investor. Acute care type facilities,  the other hand, are likely    greater demand.  addition,   developer with experience  senior care facilities  Australia said, You have  take  long-term view and particularly target your demographic pretty weli.    not looking  moving into  part  that demographic that  probably the broadest, which actually  the demographic that can probably least afford .   more likely   into the wealthier end  the market where you can provide  pretty high standard  accommodation. Beyond that, the industry wili have  find  investment framework for its chosen modei. According  the same developer,   looking   number  models, and that  part  the problem: what  the right one not even for Asia, but for each country?  Australia, the modei has gone toward  split management fee between management and operator.  other countries that  too complex,     different  might   rentai modei;  might   management-fee modei;  could   bond, like  Hong Kong;  could also  part   health care REIT.  there   whole raft  different approaches you could take. Self-Storage Asia  smali living spaces mean that increasingly wealthy consumers are running out  space  store the things they  bought, creating demand for third-party storage facilities. According  one investor active  this area, Asians use self- storage   different way than  developed countries, where people probably have more possessions:  the West,   like renting  extra garage;  Asia,   like renting  closet,  said.  one recent Japanese investment, cap rates registered between  and  percent, with financing available   per - cent. Self-storage   possible play  other parts  Asia also, but each market has its quirks and  some cases, these make investments problematic.  China, for instance, the market  stili too early because people with  lot  money who therefore need more space probably already have resi- dentiai units that are sitting empty. And  Hong Kong and Singapore, the alternative-use value for potentiai self-storage assets  probably too high  justify the purchase price  property suitable for conversion. Sustainable Buildings Creating sustainable commerciai buildings has long been  the agenda  Asian developers, but  the past the concept failed  achieve much traction largely due  the percep - tion that building green generates more costs than can  recouped during the lifetime  the building. That perception, however, may  starting  shift.   representative   large developer operating across Asia said, Developers who say that you don  get extra value  think they  living  the dark ages.    competi - tive advantage because tenants, investors, and governments demand . Those looking  flip projects for  quick profit may  less inclined   the extra mile. But given the trend toward developers building and holding assets over time, people wili look for how  maximize value, and any enlight - ened long-term investor  going  ask, How   prevent  building from becoming  dinosaur, how   continue  attract investors? Measuring the extent  which  sustainable approach wili enhance the value   building over the long term  hard  assess.  terms  higher rents, however, the benefits while tangible remain modest.  one interviewee said, There  some element  markup,  some element  credit being given now for sustainability, but  doesn  represent the true return you would like  see    markup, but  more than that.

However, the poor quality  much  Asia  commerciai stock, combined with the high cost  land   proportion  totai development value, means   often cheaper  tear down old buildings and start again. Beyond that, governments need   more  incentivize owners  undertake retrofit - ting projects, preferably via  carrot and stick approach,  one interviewee put . Markets like Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Australia, where building standards are usually higher, are seen  particularly weli suited for retrofitting plays. Take Development Risk Another way  enhance returns   enter  the development levei.

Tapering What Does  Mean? Although investor sentiment  this year  Emerging Trends survey remains strong  generai, there was stili significant concern surrounding two main themes. The first relates  the possibility   further slowing  the Chinese economy, creating  knock- impact for the rest  the Asia Pacific region  terms  both direct and export- processing trade. This has been  longstanding source  anxiety among Asian investors that has been noted  previ - ous editions  this report. However, there seems   little prospect  further economic slowing  the mainland over the short term given that Beijing continues  provide stimulus whenever the economy seems  the brink  stalling. What appears    mini-stimulus took effect during the third quarter  2o13, with gross domestic product GDP growth rising  .  percent year  year from  low  .  percent the previous quarter, more  less   par with growth  2o12. The easing has probably contributed  the strong pickup  China  residentiai reai estate pricing and sales  the second half  2o13. Another and probably bigger issue for Asian inves - tors  concern about the consequences for locai economies   tapering  the . .

Although the tapering ultimately failed  materialize  expected, leaving locai capitai markets and currencies  retrace some  most losses, the extent  which Asia remains exposed  whiplash from capitai outflows was  ominous sign.   true that most reai estate assets  Asia with the obvious exception  those listed  locai exchanges are not directly affected  these portfolio outflows, but the indirect impact can stili  considerable.  one consultant said, The flows were coming  through emerging-market bond funds, and eventually filtered through the banking system into the consumer sector and also  the developers.    not necessarily hot money going into reai estate directly, but the hot money can stimulate demand, which stimulates invest - ment and ends  coming through into reai estate indirectly.

The key question : When rates  eventually begin mov - ing back toward historicai norms, what wili the impact ? One investor said, Conventionally,  interest rates  , cap rates have     weli, which means property prices fali. There are, however, various nuances  this principle, the most important  which  perhaps that when investors enjoy  big yield spread  they currently   many Asian markets  increase  interest rates wili simply return the yield spread  its own historicai norm without requiring cap rates  move. Rising interest rates are therefore likely  have  dispro - portionate impact  asset pricing  two situations: Where yields are already super-compressed,   mar - kets such  Hong Kong and Singapore; and  markets such  Australia, Japan, and India, where investors are already betting   element  cap rate com - pression  justify projected returns. This  particularly the case  Australia, where globai funds targeting core assets  rates , say, .  percent wili find that shrinking Australian yield spreads wili lessen the appeai  locai assets relative  similar properties  . . gateway markets, where cap rates are expected  move out. Said one fund manager, Australia prime assets that are  .  look ludicrous those cap rates look like outliers, and given what  happened with the ten-year . .

This  partly because they are more liquid, and partly because they are more sensitive  interest rate movements than other types  assets. The physicai market,  contrast, has been left unscathed.

However, while talk  tapering  therefore unlikely  affect allocations  Asia, most investors concede that the macro-implications  portfolio outflows combined with the prospect  higher interest rates are likely, over time,  trickle down  affect asset prices.

Finally, reai estate markets  both the United States and Europe currently offer better risk-adjusted returns.   result,  one investor said,  you look  capitai flows, you  probably find there  more money coming out  Asia than  coming into .

Setting   team and learning the ropes  the locai mar - kets from scratch, however, can prove tricky, and quite often these funds are opting  -invest alongside private-equity money. There are various reasons for this.  one manager   large private equity fund  Hong Kong said, Opportunities for -investing with sovereign money  certainly something that comes , both because  allows them  build their direct investment expertise, and also because  allows them  dollar-cost-average the fees.  addition, although they can write very large tickets, they often lack the internai band - width  manage and underwrite risk properly.

Fundraising Stili Tough Although the second half  2o13 saw  number  high-profile capitai-raising announcements for Asia-based funds, the environment for most  those trying  attract new capitai remains subdued. Funds are spending more time  the road trying  raise capitai and many are coming  short  their targets.   coming back  little bit, but   not roaring back,  one fund manager put . Although locai funds raising locai capitai seem   thriving,  evidenced   poli published  the third quarter  2o13  data provider Preqin  which  percent  Asian institutions stated that they intended  invest  direct reai estate assets over the next  months, compared with just  percent  North America and  percent  Europe.   great extent, the prospects  success for raising new capitai depend  the type and history  the fund.  one fund manager said,     inflection point because,  the one hand, you have the old guard that has trouble given their track record, and  the other you have the first-time funds  Asia, which have  track record, and they  also having trouble.  another manager observed, Very specific targeted funds with  narrow investment focus wili tend   weli because there wili always  clients looking for niche strategies  regionai-specific teams.

Bank Doors Wide Open Compared with those  the United States and Europe, credit markets  Asia have long been dominated  the banking sector.

But  most places, banks remain effectively the only game  town, and that seems unlikely  change. Over the last severai years, bank funding for reai estate deals has been readily available  most major markets, bar China and India, and that has remained the case  2o13. The question for the future : How wili  higher-interest-rate environment affect the way deals get financed? The obvious answer  that debt wili become more expensive, but that  only one aspect. One fund manager asked, Wili there   much liquidity  the debt market? Wili banks stili have appetite  grow their loan books for reai estate? What kinds  spreads are going   charged? And are they stili reai estate ?  far, there has been some talk  Asian banks tightening standards for commerciai lending and increasing their rates  longer-term loans. But interviewees reported few   signs  pressure  shorter-term rates.  fact,  anything, the environment  2o13 has been more accommo - dating than  previous years.

For five-year fixed-rate money, you can get   about 11o  12o basis points ali . Investors  other parts  Asia also are tapping fixed-rate credit where available. Outside Japan, lending terms may not  quite  accom - modating, but credit  stili easily available.  Australia, where banks have been less enthusiastic about reai estate invest - ments ever since the globai financiai crisis, the environment changed significantly  2o13 after top-tier REITs diversified their borrowing sources  seeking alternative financing  the United States and Europe. The resulting drop  demand for credit meant that domestic banks had problems filling their loan books, and they are now more open  providing loans. Nonetheless, one interviewee said that they  stili pretty con - servative over here,  they  lend against good covenants, but  you haven  got  good covenant,   pretty hard. And another investor commented, The banks  Australia are very keen  put money out now, but  the same time they don  get too racy  the terms   you have  high-quality cash flow situation, you get  lot  attention from banks.

Although the retaii market  Beijing remains strong, the city  office sector has seen both prices and rents plateau since the beginning  2o13, after three years  high growth.

Residentiai Although residentiai plays have long been  evergreen for Asian investors given their self-liquidating nature, they are perhaps not  popular   previous years, for  number  reasons. First, prices  many Asian markets are very high. Second, the prospect  higher interest rates  the fairly near future wili make residentiai mortgages less affordable.

With the office sector proving hard  break into given locai competition for assets and  possible issue with oversupply, residentiai assets are now the number-one avenue into the market for many foreign investors. Office The office sector continues   popular  principle, but  practice  suffers from  very obvious problem: fevered competition from too much investment capitai fighting over the same deals, especially  core assets.  one investor put , There  too much money, too much liquidity  certain markets, and yet foreign funds stili  deals because they have too much capitai and they have  deploy .   result, cap rates  many cities have become compressed beyond what many investors and especially foreign funds are willing  pay   environment where rising interest rates threaten  undermine the viability  deals set  current price levels.

Manila also offers the highest prime office yields  Asia, averaging about  percent.

China, for instance, the explosion  retaii projects  secondary and ter - tiary cities  likely  create fallout because demand  those markets  insufficient  support  many projects.

But even  tier-three city has its prime shopping core area, and  you can find  site that   that core area and  ticks ali the normai criteria,  can  fine.
